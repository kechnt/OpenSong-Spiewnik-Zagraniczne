  <lyrics>[V1] 
.Em7                    G
 Was a time as a little boy,
.                      D
 When I said 'I follow you'.
.Em7                           G
 But the years have caused the flame,
.                      D
 To burn much stronger now.||
.Em7                                G
 And I'm not burning down any of my bridges,
.                     D
 But I'm burning up inside.
.Em7                 G                          D
 To flee from my religion and love my neighbour more.

[C]
.Em7
 I'm not ashamed of the gospel,
.G                            D
 I'm not ashamed of the one I love.
.Em7
 I'm not ashamed of the gospel,
.G                            D 
 I'm not ashamed of the one I love.

[V2]
.Em7                           G
 There where times in my bitterness 
.                           D
 when I felt your pure affection.
.Em7                                                 G
 And you hear my frail petitions to serve you endlessly.
.                                            D
 But I have loved the tree that they put you on? ||
.Em7                            G
 Or my friend who met me at the cross?
.                                  D
 Oh I want to sing again for my brother
.Em7
 And find my way down this mountain.</lyrics></song>

[V1]
.C                          Csus
 You should see the stars tonight,
.         C                 Csus
 How they shimmer, shine so bright.
.            C                   Csus
 Against the black, they look so white,
.       C                Csus
 Coming down from such a height
.            G                 F
 To reach me now; You reach me now.

[V2]
 You should see the moon in flight,
 Cutting 'cross the misty night,
 Softly dancing in sunshine.
 Reflections of it's light
 Reach me now; You reach me now.

[C]
.G                         F
 And how could such a thing|shine it's light on me
.G                  F
 And make ev'rything|beautiful again?

[V3]
 You should feel the sun in spring,
 Coming out after a rain.
 Suddenly, all is green,
 Sunshine on ev'rything.
 I can feel it now; I feel You now.

[V4]
 You should hear the angels sing,
 All gathered 'round their King,
 More beautiful than you could dream.
 I've been quietly listening.
 You can hear them now; I hear them now.

[C2]
 And how could such a King|shine His light on me
 And make ev'rything|beautiful again?

[C3]
 And how could such a King shine His light on me
 And make ev'rything beautiful?

[B]
.          G
 I want to shine; I want to be light.
.                     F
 I want to tell You, 'it'll be alright.'
.              G
 And I want to shine, and I want to fly,
.                    F
 Just to tell You, 'now it'll be alright.'||
.           G      F .          G   F
 It'll be alright;   It'll be alright.

[T]
.G                              F
 'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to You.
.G                             F
 But this light that shines on me shines on You||
.                                 C   Csus
 And makes ev'rything beautiful again.||
.           C   Csus          C
 It'll be alright; It'll be alright.

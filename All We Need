.       G                      D/F#
 'Cause we have all we need in You,
.                   Em7
 And all we need is You;
.               C/G
 All we need is You. (2X)


[V]
.G                             D/F#
 Rich or poor, God, I want You more
.                                    Em7
 Than anything that glitters in this world;
.                         C
 Be my all, all consuming fire.||
.    G                             D/F#    
 And You can have all my hands can hold,
.                                  Em7
 My heart, mind, and strength, and soul;
.                         C
 Be my all, all consuming fire.


[B]
.Em           Am
 He's all we need.
.Em           Am
 He's all we need
.Em                    C
 'Cause You're all we need.
.
 All we need, all we need.


[T]
.       G            D            Em7     Cmaj7
 All we need, all we need, all we need is You.
.       G            D            Em7     Cmaj7
 All we need, all we need, all we need is You.</lyrics></song>

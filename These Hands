[V1]
.C               D              C                 D              C
 The sun and moon and every star are there to show me who You are.
.         D                   Am              C
 I can be sure Your fingerprints are everywhere.||
.C            D               C                    D                 C
 My every move, my every breath, were meant to point to Your greatness.
.               D                  Am                    B
 There's nothing made that was not made to show Your power.

[C]
.G                    D 
 These hands were made to praise You.  
.Em                  C              G
 These lips were made to lift You up.
.G         D              Am     B  C
 I give to You my life in worship.||
.G              D    
 These feet were made to serve You;
.Em              C                 G
 This tongue, to sing of Your great love.
.G         D              Am     B  C
 I give to You my life in worship.

[V2]
.C             D                C               D              C
 A tender thought, a caring deed, a gift of love to one in need,
.         D              Am                 B
 Bringing honest acts of worship to You, Lord.

[B]
.Am          C             G      B    D
 Lifting holy hands in worship to You, Lord.
.Am        C             G             E 
 God receive this humble sacrifice of praise.

[T]
.C                Am    C                 Am      C
 I give to You my life, my life to you in worship,
.C         D
 In worship,
.C         D
 In worship.
.C        D      C        G 
 My life, I give in worship.</lyrics></song>

.G         G/B       D     
 Almighty, most Holy God!
.C                    Em   D 
 Faithful through the ages;
.G         G/B       D      
 Almighty, most Holy Lord!
.C           Em  D  G     
 Glorious, Almighty God.

[V1]
.    D             G          D            G       G/D                     D      
 The beasts of the field,|the birds of the air are silent to call out Your Name;
.    D            G          D         G             G/D            D        
 The earth has no voice,|and I have no choice but to magnify God unashamed;||
.        Am            D          G   G/B  C     
 Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day,
.        Am               D            G  G/B D     
 Let the whole world sing out, let the people say!

[V2]
.     D            G       D             G          G/B                      D       
 Well time marches on|with the innocence gone and a darkness has covered the earth;
.        D            G          D              G              G/D                        D       
 But His Spirit still dwells,|He speaks, "It is well," and the hopeless still offered new birth;||
.        Am                 D              G    G/B C       
 He will break the leash of death, it will have no  sting,
.        Am          D              G     G/B D      
 Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing!</lyrics></song>

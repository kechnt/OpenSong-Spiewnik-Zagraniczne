1What child is this who laid to rest |On Mary's lap is sleeping?
2Why lies He in such mean estate |Where ox and ass are feeding?
3So bring Him incense gold and myrrh |Come rich and poor to own Him
.
1Whom angels greet with anthems sweet |While shepherd watch are keeping?
2Good Christian fear for sinners here |The silent Word is pleading
3The King of kings salvation brings |Let loving hearts enthrone Him
.
1This, this is Christ the King |Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
2Nails, spears shall pierce Him thru |The cross be borne for me, for you
3Raise, raise the song on high |The virgin sings her lullaby
.
1Haste, haste to bring Him laud |The babe, the son of Mary
2Hail, hail the Word made flesh |The babe, the son of Mary
3Joy, joy for Christ is born |The babe, the son of Mary

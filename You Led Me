.G Am Bm   Am  G   Am       Bm   Am
 Good morning; the night is over and gone.
.G Am   Bm Am   G    Am         Bm       Am
 I thought once this dark would last for so long.

[P]
.Em   D   C        Em D  C
 Feel the sunlight on my face.
.Em  D    C          Em      D    C
 You have brought me through this place.

[C]
.G      D      Em  D     C
 Jesus, Jesus, You found me.
.G           D           Em  D   C
 Through the long night, you led me;
.    Em  D  C
 You set me free.

[V2]
.G Am  Bm  Am G    Am          Bm      Am
 Do you see   just what You've done in my life?
.G Am  Bm   Am G    Am     Bm         Am
 You gave me   more than I hoped for; now I...

[P2]
.Em   D    C        Em D  C
 Feel Your sunlight on my face.
.Em  D    C          Em      D    C
 You have brought me through this place.

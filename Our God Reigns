  <lyrics>[V1]
.G/B        C      D                 C       G
 How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him,
.                Am  D      G
 Who brings good news, good news;
.G/B        C         D                C    G
 Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
.        Am    D         G      C G
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!

[C]
.        C               G      C G
 Our God reigns, our God reigns,
.G/B     C     Am        G      C G
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!

[V2]
.G/B          C         D            C     G
 You watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one,
.               Am   D               G
 Shout for your King, shout for your King;
.G/B        C        D              C G
 See eye to eye, the Lord restoring Zion,
.        Am    D         G      C
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!

[V3]
.G/B        C        D                   C    G
 Out of the tomb, He came with grace and majesty,
.       Am   D       G
 He is alive, He is alive;
.G/B          C       D                   C         G
 God loves us so, see here His hands, His feet, His side,
.       Am   D       G    C G
 Yes we know, He is alive.</lyrics></song>

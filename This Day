.C F G C Am F C  

[V1]
.C            Am
 It's 6 A.M.; I'm so tired.
.Em                  F       G
 The alarm sounds; a new day begins.
.C           Am
 Before I go and disturb this peaceful moment,
.Em         G
 I look to You.

[C] 
.C               F
 I want to say a prayer 
.G         C                Am
 Before my feet can hit the ground.
.             F           G
 Lord, I give this day to You.

[V2]
.C          Am
 I'm amazed how you forgive me.
.Em                 F   G
 Yesterday seems so far behind.
.C                         Am
 It's a brand new day, and every day's a new beginning.
.Em        G
 I look to You.

[B]
.C
 Breathe in. (I breathe in)
.Am
 Breathe out. (I breathe out) 
.        G      C         Am    G
 Breathe in and watch the day begin.
.G
 I wanna watch the day begin.

[T]
.  F                C
 I give this day to you.</lyrics></song>

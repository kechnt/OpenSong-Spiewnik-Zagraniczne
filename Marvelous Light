  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                    C2
 I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope.
.G                           C2
 Your kindness wakened me, wakened me from my sleep.||
.G                          C2
 Your love it beckons deeply, a call to come and die.
.G                            C2
 By grace now I will come|and take this life, take Your life.
 

[P]
.Em7                     D
 Sin has lost its power. Death has lost its sting.
.Em7                          C
 From the grave You've risen, victoriously!

 
[C]
.G
 Into marvelous light I'm running, 
.C2
 Out of darkness, out of shame.
.Em7                D
 By the cross, You are the Truth,
.    C2                            G Gsus  
 You are the Life, You are the Way.
 

[V2]
.G                           C2
 My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean.
.G                            C2
 Your breath fills up my lungs. Now I'm free! Now I'm free! (2X)

 
[B]
.G
 Lift my hands and spin around!
.C2          
 See the light that I have found!
.Em7      Dsus             C2
 Oh the marvelous light, marvelous light!</lyrics>

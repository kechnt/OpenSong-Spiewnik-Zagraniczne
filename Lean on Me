[V1]
 Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
 We all have sorrows, but if we are wise
 We know that there's always tomorrow
 
[V2]
 Lean on me, when you're not strong
 And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on,
 For it won't be long, til I'm gonna need, 
 Somebody to lean on
 
[V3]
 Just call on me brother, when you need a hand,
 We all need somebody to lean on,
 I might just have a problem, that you'd understand,
 We all need somebody to lean on

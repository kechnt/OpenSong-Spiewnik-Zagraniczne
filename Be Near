  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm7        G2         Bm7            G2
 You are all, big and small, beautiful.
.Bm7          G2                          Bm7
 How wonderful  to trust in grace through faith,
.                  G2
 But I'm asking to taste.


[P]
.Em7                   D2/F#
 For dark is light to You,
.                      G2
 Depths are height to You,
.                  Asus            A
 Far is near, but, Lord, I need to hear from You.


[C]
.   D2        D/C#
 Be near, O God.
.      Bm7    D2/A
 Be near, O God   of us.
.         G2   D2/F#        Asus   A         
 Your nearness is   to us our   good.
.   D         D2/C#
 Be near, O God.
.      Bm7    D2/A
 Be near, O God of us.
.         G2   D2/F#        Asus   A (to chorus)         
 Your nearness is   to us our   good, 
.  Bm7   A (to verse)
 Our  good.


[V2]
 Your fullness is mine, revelation divine.
 But, oh to taste, to know more than a page,
 To feel Your embrace.</lyrics></song>

.G                   Gsus              G                  Gsus
 I could travel over oceans, cross the deserts, climb the mountains
.C                  C2               C                    C2
 Just to share your story, bring you glory, and win souls for you.
.G                 Gsus               G             Gsus
 I could sing like an angel, songs so humble and so thankful,
.C                    C2                 C               C2    E G G D
 Full of drama and emotion, so the world would know your truth.||
.D                    G/B          C              C/B
 I could give away my money and my clothes and my food
.Am                      G/B           C
 To restore those people who are poor, lost, and down-and-out.
.D                      G/B 
 Oh, I could succeed at all these things,
.     C                     C/B
 Find favor with peasants and kings,
.Am              Dmute      G      Gsus G GsusMute
 But if I do not love, I am nothing.

[V2]
 I could live a flawless life, never cheat or steal or lie,
 And always speak so kindly, smile warmly, and go about doing good.
 I could dedicate myself to do what everyone else wants me to-
 Listen to them, compliment them, say the things I should. ||
 I could show up every Sunday, lead the choir and Bible study
 And they all might come to know me as a leader and a friend.
 Oh, I could achieve success on earth, 
 But success cannot define my worth,
.Am                     G/B                  C
 And all these actions, all these words, will not matter in the end.

[C]
.D                  G/B
 Songs will fade to silence,
.E/G#               Am
 Stories, they will cease.
.D             G       C        F      D
 The dust will settle, covering all my selfless deeds.
.D       Eb(dim)   Em
 So as I strive to serve you,
.          C       C/B      Asus A
 Won't you make it clear to me,
.Am          D          G       G/F#
 If I do not love, I am nothing.

[B]
.Em     Bm             D    Eb(dim)   Em
   If I cannot live my life loving my brother,
.   Cm  C/B     Am               F                  D 
 Then how can I love the one who lived his life for me?

[V3]
 Sent to earth from heaven,
 Humble servant, holy king,
 Come to share a story, get no glory, and save my searching soul,
 You knew that I'd deny you, crucify you, but nothing could stop you from
.C                        C2                      E G G D
 Living for me, dying for me, so that I would know:</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V]
.A        C        D
 Set this place on fire,
.A         C       D
 Send Your Spirit, Savior;
.A      C        D
 Rescue from the mire,
.A         C       D
 Show Your servant favor.
.D                          C
 Yesterday was the day that I was alone,
.    G                      E7
 Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God.

[C]
.        A    F       C         G
 Yes our God, He is a consuming fire,
.        A      F         D
 And the flames burn down deep in my soul;
.        A   F       C         G
 Yes our God He is a consuming fire,
.   A         F           D                             A    C D   A C D
 He reaches inside and He melts down this cold heart of stone.

[T]
.Em      G              D                      Am
 Did you realize that inside of you there is a flame?
.Em      G                  D
 Did you ever try to let it burn
.                    A
 Let it burn, let it burn?</lyrics></song>

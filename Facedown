  <lyrics>;CAPO 6

[V1]
.Am                E
 Welcomed into the courts of the King,
.    Cmaj7                 D2
 I am    ushered into your presence.
.Am                    E
 Lord, I stand on Your merciful ground,
.        Cmaj7                     D2
 Yet with    every step tread with reverence.


[C]
.         C        F
 And I'll fall facedown
.        Am    G       F
 As Your glory shines around.
.          C        F
 Yes, I'll fall facedown
.        Am    G       F
 As Your glory shines around.


[V2]
.Am                  E
 Who is there in the heavens like You?
.     Cmaj7                      D2
 And upon  the earth, who's Your equal?
.        Am                    E
 You are far above, You're the highest of heights;
.       Cmaj7          D2
 We are bowing down to exalt you.


[B]
.F                        G
 So let Your glory shine around.
.                      F
 Let Your glory shine around.
.                      G
 King of glory here be found. King of glory.


[T]
.Am                E
 Welcomed into the courts of the King,
.    Cmaj7                 D2
 I am    ushered into your presence.

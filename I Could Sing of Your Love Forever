.E
 Over the mountains and the sea,
.F#m
 Your river runs with love for me,
.A                     B
 And I will open up my heart
.
 And let the Healer set me free.||
.E
 I'm happy to be in the truth,
.F#m
 And I will daily lift my hands,
.A
 For I will always sing
.   B
 Of when Your love came down.

[C]
.E                    F#m
 I could sing of Your love forever.
.A                    B
 I could sing of Your love forever.
.E                    F#m
 I could sing of Your love forever.
.A                    B
 I could sing of Your love forever.

[B]
.F#m             E/G#
 Oh, I feel like dancing.
.A                   B
 It's foolishness, I know.
.F#m                    E/G#
 But when the world has seen the light,
.          A                         B
 They will dance with joy like we're dancing now.</lyrics>

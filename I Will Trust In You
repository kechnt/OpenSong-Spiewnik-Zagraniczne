  <lyrics>[V1]
.             C       
 When I can't see You, I know You're here.
.             Am7
 When I can't feel You, I will not fear.
.       F        C
 I will trust in You
.      Am7      F       C
 And I will not be afraid.


[V2]
 And when the battle is close at hand,
 I know You're with me to help me stand.
 I will trust in You
 And I will not be afraid.


[C]
.       Am7     Em7
 I will not be afraid.
.       Am7     Em7
 I will not be afraid.
.                F    Dm7
 I will trust in You.
.       G        C
 I will trust in You.


[V3]
 And when the darkness is closing in,
 And I am running against the wind:
 I will trust in You
 And I will not be afraid.


[V4]
 'Cause when I'm standing upon that shore,
 And all the battles, theys have gone before:
 I will trust in You
 And I will not be afraid.</lyrics>

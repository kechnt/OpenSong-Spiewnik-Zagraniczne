.D                                G      D
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!
.D                       Bm      E        A7
 Makes the lame to walk, and the blind to see.
.D                            G        D
 Opens prison doors, sets the captives free!
.D                        Bm      D   A  D
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!

[C]
.G                            D
 Spring up, O well, within my soul!
.G                  E7          A
 Spring up, O well, and make me whole!
.G                           D    
 Spring up, O well, and give to me
.G    D    A        D
 That life abundantly.</lyrics></song>

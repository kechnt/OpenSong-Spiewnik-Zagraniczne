  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                 E       E2                     F#m7
 I stand among the millions, and I can't help but feel so small,
.                         D                                           E             Esus
 For I am just a speck of dust, a particle existing on this great big spinning ball.
.                      E    E2                 F#m7
 The part of me that's human, it tells me I am not that strong,
.                      D                                                E      EsusE
 There's a power in my soul, greater than us all, and I'm reminded I am not my own.

[C]
.    D2           C#m
 I'm yielded to a higher calling: I'm...
.E                                      C#m7
 One voice, shining through the darkest night.
.                                   A2
 One voice, standing up for what is right.
.                                    F#m7
 One voice, nothing more and nothing less,
.       D                                      E
 Than a voice crying out, a voice in the wilderness.

[V2]
.E                E     E2                        F#m7
 The voices of confusion, can fill a world that's all my own.
.                         D
 Running havoc through my mind, all the truth and all the lies,
.                         E                Esus
 It's so hard to sift the right from wrong.
.                     E        E2                           F#m7
 In the middle of the choosing, through the clutter of this human noise,
.                          D
 When my words fall to the ground, all the dust has settled down,
.                         E           Esus  E
 All that matters is Your still small voice.</lyrics>

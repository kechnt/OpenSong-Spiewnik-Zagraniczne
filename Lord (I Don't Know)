.Em Em Em Em Em Em G D

[V1]
.Em          G         D
 You are the author of knowledge.
.Em        G                D
 You can redeem what's been done.
.Em           G           D             C
 You hold the present and all that's to come
.
 Until your everlasting kingdom.

[C]
.G                D         Am            C              G         D
   Lord, I don't know where all this is going,|or how it all works out.
.G            D             Am             C              G        D
   Lead me to peace that is past understanding,|a peace beyond all doubt.

[V2]
.Em          G        D
 You are the God of tomorrow,
.Em          G           D
 Turning the darkness to dawn,
.Em          G             D          C
 Lifting the hopeless with hope to go on.
.
 You are the Rock of all salvation.

[B]
.    C
 Oh, Lord, you are the author,
.  G                   D
 Redeeming what's been done.
.    C
 You hold us in the present
.    G              D
 And all that is to come. (2X)

[T]
.G                D          Am            C              G         D
   Lord, we don't know where all this is going,|or how it all works out.
.G            D             Am             C              G        D
   Lead us to peace that is past understanding,|a peace beyond all doubt.</lyrics></song>

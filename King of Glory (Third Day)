  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D5                 D5(+7)       D5/G                D5/A  D5/G
 Who is this King of Glory that pursues me with His love,
.    D5                      D5(+7)       D5/G              D5/A  D5/G
 And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words?||
.   G2                          Bm7
 My conscience a reminder of forgiveness that I need,
.    A(4)                 G2                D5  
 Who is this King of Glory, who offers it to me?


[V2]
 Who is this King of angels, oh blessed Prince of Peace,
 Revealing things of heaven and all it's mysteries?||
 My spirit's ever longing for His grace in which to stand,
 Who is this King of Glory, Son of God and Son of Man?


[C]
.D             G               Bm7
 His name is Jesus, precious Jesus;
.       A(4)            G2                D5
 Lord Almighty, King of my heart,|King of Glory.


[V3]
 Who is this King of Glory with strength and majesty,
 And wisdom beyond measure, oh gracious King of Kings?||
 The Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator of all things,
 He is the King of Glory, He's everything to me.


[T]
.       A(4)            G2                D5
 Lord Almighty, King of my heart,|King of Glory.</lyrics>

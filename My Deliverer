[V1]
.Em                                   C           G
 Joseph took his wife and a child and went to Africa.
.C             Em               Bsus
 To escape the rage of a deadly king.
.Em                                       C               G
 There along the banks of the Nile. Jesus listened to the song,
.C                Em               Bsus
 That the captive children used to sing.|They were singing:

[C]
.Em   C          Em      C    G       D           C  D
 My Deliverer is coming, my Deliverer is standing by.
.Em   C          Em      C    G       D           C
 My Deliverer is coming, my Deliverer is standing by.
.Em C Em C G D C D

[V2]
.Em                              C                     G
 Through a dry and thirsty land, water from the Kenyan heights.
.C                   Em                   Bsus
 Pours itself out of Lake Sangri's broken heart.
.Em                               C                     G
 There in the Sahara winds, Jesus heard the whole world cry,
.C                          Em                Bsus
 For the healing that would flow from His own scars.|The world was singing:

[B1]
.C                       G               C       G           C
 He will never break His promise, He has written it upon the sky.

[B2]
.C                      G                 C        G                 C
 I will never doubt His promise, though I doubt my heart, I doubt my eyes.

[B3]
.C                       G                   C            G                    C
 He will never break His promise,|though the stars should break faith with the sky.</lyrics>

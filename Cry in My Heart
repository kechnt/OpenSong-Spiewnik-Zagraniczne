  <lyrics>[V]
.          D
 There's a cry in my heart
.         A
 For Your glory to fall,
.         Em                     A
 For Your presence to fill up my senses.
.          D
 There's a yearning again,
.  A
 A thirst for discipline,
.  Em                            A
 A hunger for things that are deeper.


[P1]
.          Bm      G
 Could You take me beyond?
.          D        A
 Could You carry me through?
.     Bm      G 
 If I open my heart
.        D             A
 Could I go there with You?


[P2]
.         Bm        G
 For I've been here before,
.      D                  A
 But I know there's still more.
.    Bm              A
 Oh, Lord, I need to know You.


[C]
.              G                         D
 For what do I have if I don't have You, Jesus?
.             A                   Bm
 What in this life could mean any more?
.           G                D
 You are my Rock. You are my Glory.
.            A            Bm
 You are the Lifter of my head.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D           Am7
 Worthy is the Lamb Who was slain;
.C             G
 Holy, holy is He.||
.D             Am7
 Sing a new song to Him who sits on
.C              G
 Heaven's mercy seat.

[C]
.D              Am7
 Holy, holy, holy|is the Lord God Almighty
.C                        G
 Who was and is and is to come.||
.D                        Am7
 With all creation I sing
.
 Praise to the King of kings||
.C           
 You are my ev'rything
.    G            D    Am7  C  G (to verse)
 And I will adore You

[V2]
 Clothed in rainbows of living color,
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder.||
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory
 And power be to You, the only wise King.

[V3]
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
 At the mention of Your name.||
 Jesus, Your name is power, breath and living water.
 Such a marv'lous mystery, yeah.</lyrics>

.F  C  D

[V1]
.Am                 F     Am
 Tears have fallen. Water beads.
.                    Em   F
 Wipe the floor with my regrets.
.Am              F    Am
 In the crevice, tiny seeds
.                    Em       F
 Spring to life from pardoned debts.
.G
 And all I have, all I have is

[C1]
.F             C              Am
 Praises on my tongue from my heart
.        G              F
 For our God who became flesh.
.       C         Am
 For us all, unto you 
.       G
 I will sing my praises,
.
 Sing forever.

[V2]
.Am            F   Am
 In the quiet, I lament
.               Em      F
 Every nail, my sin did buy.
.Am           F       Am
 And I wonder why you spent
.                Em      F
 Lavish blood on such as I.
.G
 When all I have, all I have is

[B]
.F         C                   G
 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,
.
 To sing aloud, sing aloud.
.F          C                   G
 Oh, to the Glory of my God and King,
.
 To sing aloud, sing aloud. (2X)

[C2]
.F             C              Am
 Praises on my tongue from my heart
.        G              F
 For our God who became flesh.
.       C         Am
 For us all, unto you 
.       G
 I will ever sing my, ever sing my

[C3]
.F             C              Am
 Praises on my tongue from my heart
.        G              F
 For our God who became flesh.
.       C         Am
 For us all, unto you
.       G
 I will ever sing these

[T]
.G
 This is the truth
.   F               C
 Of God and man and life.

  <lyrics>[V]
.E/G#   A2      Bsus              B
 I'm forgiven because You were forsaken.
.E/G#  A2      Bsus        B
 I'm accepted, You were condemned.
.E/G# A2                  Bsus          B
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me,
.  A2        B              E
 Because You died and rose again.

[V1]
 Before the day, before the light,
 Before the world revolved around the sun,||
 God on high stepped down into time
 And wrote the story
 Of His love for everyone.

[P]
 He has filled our hearts with wonder
 So that we always remember:

[C]
 You and I are made to worship.
 You and I are called to love.
 You and I are forgiven and free.||
 When you and I embrace surrender,
 When you and I choose to believe,
 Then you and I will see
 Who we were meant to be.

[V2]
 All we are and all we have
 Is all a gift from God that we receive.||
 Brought to life, we open up our eyes
 To see the majesty and glory of the King.

[B]
 Even the rocks cry out,
 Even the heavens shout
 At the sound of His Holy name.||
 So let ev'ry voice sing out,
 Let ev'ry knee bow down;
 He's worthy of all our praise.

[C2]
 You and I are made to worship.
 You and I are called to love.
 You and I are forgiven and free.||
 When you and I embrace surrender,
 When you and I choose to believe,
 You and I will see:

[T]
 Yeah, we were meant to be, oo.
 You and I, you and I,
 Yeah, yeah, oo,
 We were meant to be.</lyrics>

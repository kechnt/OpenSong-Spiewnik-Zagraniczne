  <lyrics>;CAPO 1

[V1]
.Am                              Am6
 You turned my way. You heard my cry.
.F/A                            G
 You turned my mourning into shouting.||
.Am                     Am6
 Sorrow may last for a night,
.              F                G
 But with the light I am seeing,|I am singing:

[C]
.C              G                 Am7
 You lifted me out,|You lifted me out,
.              F
 And set me dancing, dancing.||
. C               G                     Am7
 Free. Now I am free.|Your love rescued me.
.               F
 Now it's the anthem I'm singing.

[V2]
 Many will see, many will hear,
 And find You strong enough to save.||
 Many the wonders You have done;
 Your light has come and I am seeing,
 I am singing:

[B]
.G 
 Lost is where You found me,
.Am7                          Fmaj7
 Shattered and frail, but You love me still.||
.G                      Am7
 Trouble may surround me, my heart may fail,
.        Fmaj7           Dm7
 But You never will, You never will.

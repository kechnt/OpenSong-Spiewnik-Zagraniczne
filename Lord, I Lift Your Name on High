.G             C            D     C/D        G
 You came from heaven to earth to show the way,
.           C             D     C       G
 From the earth to the cross my debt to pay;
.            C             D
 From the cross to the grave,
.           Em7          Am7
 From the grave to the sky,
.        D                 G     C/G  D/G  C/G  G
 Lord, I lift Your Name on high.</lyrics>

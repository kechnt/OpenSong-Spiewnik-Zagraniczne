[V1]
 Caught in the half-light,
 I'm caught alone,
 Waking up to the sunrise|and the radio.||
 Feels like I'm tied up. What's holding me?
 Just praying today will be the day I go free.

[C]
 And I want to live|like there's no tomorrow.
 I want to dance like no one's around.
 I want to sing like nobody's listening
 Before I lay my body down.||
 I want to give like I have plenty.
 I want to love like I'm not afraid.
 I want to be the man|I was meant to be.
 I want to be the way I was made.


[V2]
 Made in Your likeness.
 Made with Your hands.
 Made to discover who You are|and who I am.||
 All I've forgotten,|help me to find.
 All that You've promised,|let it be in my life.

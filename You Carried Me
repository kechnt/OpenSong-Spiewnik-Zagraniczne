  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                  F#/A2
 I've been so busy, I missed the reasons
.Bm                  Em
 I missed your love, I nearly missed it all
.D                        F#/A2
 Still you've loved me, And you've healed me
.Bm                        Em
 You've given all and it brought me to your cross

[P1]
.       A2    Bm    G
 I stand only because
.      A2    Bm    G
 You've given me grace to walk
.      A2    Bm G
 Only because

[C]
.               D     A2     Bm   G
 You've carried me
.            A2
 You carried me
.            Bm            G
 You carried me through it all
.        D
 And I believe
.         A2
 Yes, I believe
.             Bm
 You'll carry me
.            G
 All the way home
.D    F#/A   B    Em
 Mercy covers all

[V2]
 I know the scripture
 I've known the songs
 I sang the words
 From my hollowed Heart
 You've spoken softly
 Through the storm
 I've heard your voice
 And felt the calm

[P2]
 I stand only because
 You've given me faith to walk

[B]
.A2                 Bm
 I know that you love me
.F#                    G
 I'll never doubt it I can't live without it
 Your mercy has found me
 I'll never doubt it I can't live without it</lyrics></song>

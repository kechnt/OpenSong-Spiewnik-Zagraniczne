.Bm        G     D     A          Bm  G    D         A
 Love unfailing, overtaking my heart.  You take me in.
.Bm             G    D            A          G
 Finding peace again, fear is lost in all You are.

[P]
.    A                                        Bm
 And I would give the world to tell Your story
.                                G
 â€˜Cause I know that You've called me,
.                         D
 I know that You've called me.||
.     A                                G
 I've lost myself for good within Your promise,
.                Bm                G
 And I won't hide it, I won't hide it.

[C]
.D                           A
 Jesus, I believe in You and I would go
.       Em                        G
 To the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.
.    D
 For You alone are the Son of God
.    C
 And all the world will see
.           Em             G
 That You are God, You are God</lyrics></song>

.G    C D  G C  G       C        G C G
 When I surv____ey, the wondrous cross,
.   G     D/F# Em     Am       D7  Am  D7
 On which the  Prince of glory died,
.   C  D    G C  G   C         G  C  G
 My richest gai__n I count but loss,
.            D7 Am D7    C   D7 G  C   G
 And pour contem___pt on all my pride.

[V2]
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
 All the vain things that charm me most,
 I sacrifice them to His blood.

[V3]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown ?

[V4]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
 That were an offering far too small,
 Love so amazing, so divine,	
 Demands my soul, my life my all.</lyrics>

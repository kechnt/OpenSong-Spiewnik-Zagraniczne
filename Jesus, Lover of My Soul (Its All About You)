  <lyrics>[1]
.A              Bm G D A
 It's all about You, Jesus,
.                    Bm G          D              A
 And all this is for You, for Your glory and Your fame;
.               Bm G       D                    G 
 It's not about me_, as if You should do things my way;
.D             A            G              D 
 You alone are God and I surrender to Your ways.

.D G    A           D 
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
.G             D               Asus  A
 All consuming fire is in Your gaze;
.D G    A             D 
 Jesus, I want You to know,
.G             D          Asus  A
 I will follow You all my days.

[3]
.    D              A          Bm   G 
 For no one else in history is like You,
.    D         A               G 
 And history itself belongs to You;
.D          G              Bm    G 
 Alpha and Omega, You have loved me,
.    D             G            Asus  A
 And I will spend eternity with You.</lyrics>

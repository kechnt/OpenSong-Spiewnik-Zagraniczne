.          Am     G C
1Father in Heaven,
2Beautiful Savior,
.               Am          G        C
1Lord, may Your name be     glori____fied
2Truly we       praise Your love for us.
.              Am     G            C
1Above all     others,  above all  this world,
2While we were sinners, in all our weakness,
.              Am         G           C
1Above every___thing else in our      lives.||
2Still  You    gave Your  life on the cross.||

.    Dm                                   Am
1For nothing else in all of this world matters
2You saved us, Lord, from all of our transgressions
.        C                              E7
1But to  live our lives for You and You alone.
2And delivered us into Your loving      arms.

.         Am
 May Your wonders never cease,
.         F
 May Your Spirit never leave,
.       C                        G
 May we ever long to see Your face.
.            Am
 And when we turn from You again,
.       F
 Oh how quickly we forget,
.       C                       G
 May we be reminded of Your grace.
.                             Am G C
 May Your wonders never cease.</lyrics>

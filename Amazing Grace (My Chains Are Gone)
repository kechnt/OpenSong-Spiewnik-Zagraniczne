[V1]
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound|that saved a wretch like me;
 I once was lost, but now I'm found,|was blind, but now I see.

[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;
 How precious did that grace appear|the hour I first believed!

[C]
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns,
 Unending love, amazing grace.

[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me;|His word my hope secures.
 He will my shield and portion be|as long as life endures.

[V4]
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine,
 But God who called me here below|will be forever mine.

[T]
 Will be forever mine.
 You are forever mine.</lyrics></song>

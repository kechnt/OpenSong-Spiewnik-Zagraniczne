  <lyrics>[V1]
.       G                             C6
 You're callin' me to lay aside the worries of my day,
.   Em7                          C
 To quiet down my busy mind and find a hiding place.||
. G/B   C2 .       Em7    C2
 Worthy!   You are worthy!||
.   G                           C6
 I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours.
.  Em7                           C
 I open up my mouth and let a song of praise come forth.||
. G/B   C2 .       Em7    C2
 Worthy!   You are worthy!


[C]
.G                     C2
 Of a childlike faith, of my honest praise,
.    Em7                C2
 And of my unashamed love.||
.G               C2
 Of a holy life,|of my sacrifice,
.    Em7              G/C
 And of my unashamed love.


[T]
.  G    C2 .       G      C2
 Worthy!   You are worthy!
.  G    C2 .       Em7    C2
 Worthy!   You are worthy!

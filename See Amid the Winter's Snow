  <lyrics>[V1]
.G    Am G/B  C        G          D   C  G     A7  D
 See amid the winter's snow, born for us on earth below,
.G        Am  G/B C     G D/F# Em       G     C   D   G
 See, the Lamb of God appears, promised from eternal years.

[C]
.           C/G G D7  G  D
 Hail, thou ever-blessed morn!
.G/B     C  G      Am G/B  D
 Hail, redemption's happy dawn!
.Em           A7  D Em A7 D
 Sing through all Jerusalem,
.G         C       G/D D  G
 Christ is born in Bethlehem!

[V2]
 Lo, within a manger lies He who built the starry skies,
 He who, throned in height sublime, sits amid the cherubim.

[V3]
 Say, ye holy shepherd, say, what your joyful new today;
 Wherefore have ye left your sheep on the lonely mountain steep?

[V4]
 As we watched at dread of night, lo, we saw a wondrous light:
 Angels singing "Peace on earth", told us of the Saviour's birth.

[V5]
 Sacred infant, all divine, what a tender love was Thine,
 Thus to come from highest bliss down to such a world as this!

[V6]
 Teach, O teach us, holy child, by Thy face so meek and mild,
 Teach us to resemble Thee in Thy sweet humility.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                        E/D#
 Praise You in the morning, praise You in the evening,
.C#m7                                        A2
 Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old.||
.E                           E/D#
 Praise You when I'm laughing, praise You when I'm grieving,
.C#m7                                A2
 Praise You every season of the soul.


[P1]
.   F#m7             A2/B
 If we could see how much You're worth,
.     F#m7                     A2/B
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love,
.     F#m7            A2/B            A2        B
 Then surely we would never cease to praise You.


[C]
.E                  E/D#
 Let everything that, everything that,
.C#m7            A2          A2/B
 Everything that has breath praise the Lord. (2X)


[V2]
.E                        E/D#
 Praise You in the heavens, joining with the angels,
.C#m7                           A2
 Praising You forever and a day.||
.E                          E/D#
 Praise You on the earth now, joining with creation,
.C#m7                               A2
 Calling all nations to Your praise.


[P2]
.   F#m7               A2/B
 If they could see how much You're worth,
.     F#m7                     A2/B
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love,
.     F#m7              A2/B            A2        B
 Then surely they would never cease to praise You.</lyrics>

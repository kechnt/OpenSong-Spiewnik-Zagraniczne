  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm        F#m7/A          G       D  A
 Saviour I come;  Quiet my soul. Remember
.Bm           F#m7/A                         G           D  A
 Redemption's hill   where Your blood was spilled for my ransom.


[P]
.Em7          Asus       A       Bm      A      Gmaj7
 Everything I once held dear, I count it all as loss.


[C]
.                     Gmaj7      D           A
 Lead me to the cross where Your Love poured out.
.               Gmaj7          D      A
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down.
.            Gmaj7     D       A
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You.
.        Em9 G       A      Bm
 Oh lead me, lead me to the cross.


[V2]
 You were as I, tempted and tried, human.
 The Word became flesh, bore my sin and death; now You're risen.


[B]
.        D     Gmaj7  A
 To Your Heart.
.        D     G  A
 To Your Heart.
.                D     Gmaj7  A
 Lead me to Your Heart.
.                D     G  A
 Lead me to Your Heart.</lyrics>

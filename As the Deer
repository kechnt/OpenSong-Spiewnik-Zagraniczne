  <lyrics>[V1]
.D      A            Bm      D/F#         G            A     D     
 As the deer panteth for the water, so my soul longeth after You; 
.D   A           Bm        D/F#         G       A       D    
 You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship You. 


[C]
.Bm               G            D          G                Em     F#       
 You alone are my strength, my shield; to You alone may my spirit yield.
.D   A            Bm        D           G       A       D     
 You alone are my heart's desire, and I long to worship You.

 
[V2]
.D         A               Bm     D/F#          G          A      D
 You're my friend, and You are my brother,|even though You are my King.
.D      A             Bm  D/F#           G         A  D
 I love You more than any other, so much more than anything. 

 
[V3]
.D      A             Bm      D/F#         G       A    D
 I want You more than gold or silver, only You can satisfy; 
.D   A             Bm       D/F#          G     A     D
 You alone are the real joy-giver|and the apple of my eye.</lyrics>

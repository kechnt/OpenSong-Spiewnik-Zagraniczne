  <lyrics>[V1]
.           D              A                 G        A        D
 Come, Thou fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
.                        A                 G        A       D
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.||
.                G       D                       G        D
 Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;
.                            A               G       A       D
 Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it, name of God's redeeming love.


[V2]
.      D               A                   G          A       D
 Hitherto Thy love has blest me; Thou hast brought me to this place,
.                         A               G       A        D
 And I know Thy hand will bring me Safely home by Thy good grace.||
.                G      D                            G       D
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
.                     A                 G        A        D
 He to rescue me from danger, Bought me with His precious blood.


[V2_Alternate]
.       D             A             G      A      D
 Here I raise mine Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I come,
.                        A                G    A       D
 And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.||
.                G      D                            G       D
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
.                     A            G         A        D
 He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.


[V3]
.       D                 A             G       A          D
 Oh, to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;
.                         A               G         A        D
 Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.||
.                 G       D                           G     D
 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love.
.                             A                G       A       D
 Here's my heart, oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.


[T]
.                            A               G       A       D
 Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it, name of God's redeeming love.</lyrics>

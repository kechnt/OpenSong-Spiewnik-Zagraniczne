  <lyrics>[V1]
.G    G/F#   Em7      Dsus
 Open up the skies of mercy.
.G    G/F#     Em7
 Rain down the cleansing flood.
.G       G/F#   Em7   Dsus
 Healing waters rise around us.
.C2                  Dsus
 Hear our cries, Lord; let 'em rise.


[C]
.          C         G          Am7
 It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance.
.       C    G              Am7
 Your favor, Lord, is our desire.||
.          C       G          Am7
 It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence
.    C                                   G
 And Your love, Your love is better than life.


[V2]
 We can feeel Your mercy falling.
 You are turning our hearts back again.
 Hear our praises rise to heaven.
 Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.</lyrics></song>

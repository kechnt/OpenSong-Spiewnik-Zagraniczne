 We come into Your presence with singing,

 Come into Your presence with praise

 Power is on its way; So we shout Hallelujah

 Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise

 Everything within me; Reaches out to You

 Your power, Your majesty; Grace and mercy too
.            D                    D                      
 There'll be singing and dancing; Hearts and voices raised

 You have set you people free; Now the house if filled with praise

 Has never failed to guide me out.

 Great is Your faithfulness

 To carry on with a sinner like me.

 Great is Your faithfulness,

 Turning shame into victory.

 Your grace has never let me be;

 Your mercy's waited patiently.

 If I hide in dark and shadows,

 Fearful of each day,

 Even there Your blinding light
.  D/E
 Illuminates my pathway.

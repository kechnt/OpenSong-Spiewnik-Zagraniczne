  <lyrics>[V1]
 O come, O come, Emmanuel,
 And ransom captive Israel
 That mourns in lonely exile here
 Until the Son of God appear.

[C]
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
 Shall come to thee, O Israel.

[V2]
 O come, Thou Wisdom, from on high
 And order all things far and nigh.
 To us the path of knowledge show,
 And cause us in her ways to go.

[V3]
 O come, O come, great Lord of might,
 Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
 In ancient times once gave the law
 In cloud and majesty and awe.

[V4]
 O come, Thou Root of Jesse's tree,
 An ensign of Thy people be.
 Before Thee rulers silent fall.
 All peoples on Thy mercy call.

[V5]
 O come, Thou Key of David, come
 And open wide our heavenly home.
 Make safe the way that leads on high
 And close the path to misery.

[V6]
 O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
 Our spirits by Thy justice here.
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
 And death's dark shadows put to flight.
---
[V7]
 O come, Desire of nations, bind
 All peoples in one heart and mind.
 From dust Thou brought us forth to life.
 Deliver us from earthly strife.

[V8]
 O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny.
 From depths of hell Thy people save
 And give them victory o'er the grave.

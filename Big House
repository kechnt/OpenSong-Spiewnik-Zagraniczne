  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                      Em               C
 I don't know where you lay your head or where you call your home.
.G                      Em                C
 I don't know where you eat your meals or where you talk on the phone.||
.G                   Em            C
 I don't know if you got a cook, a butler, or a maid.
.G                   Em                C              D     C
 I don't know if you got a yard with a hammock in the shade.


[V2]
 I don't know if you got some shelter, say, a place to hide.
 I don't know if you live with friends in whom you can confide.||
 I don't know if you got a family say a mom or dad.
 I don't know if you feel love at all, but I bet you wish you had.

.G                   C
 Come and go with me to my Father's house.
.G                   C              G
 Come and go with me to my Father's house.||
.                D                           G
 It's a big, big house with lots and lots of room.
.             D                         G
 A big, big table with lots and lots of food.
.                D                          G
 It's a big, big yard where we can play football.
.           D                       G
 A big, big house; it's my Father's house.


[V3]
 All I know is a big ol' house with rooms for everyone.
 All I know is lots of land where we can play and run.||
 All I know is you need love and I've got a family.
 All I know is you're all alone, so why not come with me?</lyrics>

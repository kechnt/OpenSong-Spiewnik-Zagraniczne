.D                   G       Asus         D
 I will offer up my life in spirit and truth,
.                        G          Asus        D
 Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You.
.             D/F#       G      Asus     Bm
 In surrender I    must give my ev'ry part.
.                    A    G          A       D
 Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart.

[C]
.                     G  Asus           D
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring,
.                      G         Asus       D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.                       G  Asus           D
 Savior, what can be said, what can be sung,
                        G           Asus              D
 As a praise of Your name, for the things You have done?
.                         Em7    D/F#       G
 Oh my words could not tell, not even in part,
.       Em7      D/F#           G     A                D G Asus
 Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart.

[V2]
 You deserve my every breath, for You've paid the great cost.
 Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross.
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin.
 Opened up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in.</lyrics>

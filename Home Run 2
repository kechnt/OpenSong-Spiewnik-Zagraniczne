  <lyrics>[B]
.Em                                        C
 We are not the first to play this game or stand over this plate.
.Em                               C
 We are surrounded by the legacy, like they're sittin' in the stands.
.C                                           Em  C  Em  G   D
 I can see them wavin' their hands, sayin', "Go ,go all the way!"

[T]
 Come on now
 Home home home run hey it's gone gone now
 Home home home run hey it's our home run

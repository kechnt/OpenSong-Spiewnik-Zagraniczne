.E
 Salvation, spring up from the ground.
.
 Lord, rend the heavens and come down.
.
 Seek the lost and heal the lame.
.
 Jesus, bring glory to Your name.||
.
 Let all the prodigals run home.
.
 All of creation waits and groans.
.
 Lord, we've heard of Your great fame.
.
 Father, cause all to shout Your name.

 Stir up our hearts, O God.
.         C#m        A           B
 Open our spirits to awe who You are.
.      C#m          A2/C#  E/B
 Put a cry in us so deep inside
.     A     E/G# Bsus/F# E/F# Esus A2       E/G#
 That we cannot  find    the       words we need
.   Esus Em   Cmaj7              Am/C Cmaj7
 We just weep        and cry out to   You.</lyrics></song>

D Eternity in Your hand..A/C#                      F#m You spoke the earth into motion,.              D My soul now to stand.  [V2].A You stood before my failure.    D And carried the cross for my shame..   A/C#                    F#m My sin weighed upon Your shoulders,.              D My soul now to stand.  [P].                D  Bm So what can I say,.                  F#m And what could I do,.                   D        E But offer this heart, O God,.              F#m Completely to You? [V3].   A So I'll walk upon salvation,.     D Your Spirit alive in me,.     A/C#                  F#m This life to declare Your promise,.              D My soul now to stand. [C].D         A So I'll stand.     E             F#m           D With arms high and heart abandoned,.   A          E       F#m         D In awe of the One who gave it all..      A I'll stand,.   E              F#m My soul, Lord, to You surrendered;.D     A         E  (F#m) All I am is Yours.</lyrics></song>

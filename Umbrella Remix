  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em G D C 

 I gave You my heart
 In exchange for a brand new start.
 Lord, then You made me clean
 And You set me apart.

[V2]
.Em G D C

 You see, I was in the dark,
 But You're the Bright and Morning Star.
 Now with Your amazing grace,
 You keep a smile upon my face.

[C]
.C G D Em

 Because...
 When the son die, He didn't die forever.
 Put Him in a tomb and three days later.
 Died on a cross and rose again.||
 Dip me in His blood and washed away my sins,|sins, sins, eh eh eh.
 Thank the Lord I'm born again,|ain, ain, hey, hey, hey, hey.</lyrics></song>

.G D Em7 C2

[V1]
.G         D
 All rise, all fall.
.Em7      C2
 I'll fail you all.
.G                    D
 We built these cities to stand so tall.
.Em7          C2
 We've lost our walls.

[P1]
.D               Em7              C2
 I don't want to lose you, coming down,
.
 With the whole world upside-down.
.D              Em7              C2
 I don't have a soul to trust in now,
.
 With the whole world upside-down.

[C]
.G      D      Em7
 We are one, tonight!
.          C2
 And we're singing it out!
.G      D      Em7
 We are one, tonight!
.          C2
 And we're dreaming out loud!||
.G          D        Em7
 Though the world is flawed,
.      C2
 These scars will heal.
.G      D      Em7
 We are one, tonight!
.C2
 Tonight!
.G       D Em7 C2
 Tonight!

[V2]
.G         D
 Two eyes, one tongue.
.Em7       C2
 I've come undone.
.G              D
 I'm no victim, I've paid these dues.
.Em7       C2
 I came to lose.

[P2]
.D               Em7            C2
 I don't want to fight about it now,
.
 With the whole world upside-down.
.D              Em7               C2
 I don't have a soul to trust in, now,
.
 With the whole world upside-down.

[B]
.D               Em7	            C2
 I don't want to lose the common ground,
.
 With the whole world upside-down.
.D               Em7	           C2
 I don't want to fight about it now,
.
 In a world that's burning out.
.                       G
 Let's slow the evening down.||
.        D
 Slow it down.
.     Em7  C2
 Slow down.
.            G
 Please slow down,
.D         Em7
 Down, down.
.    C2
 The stars are comin' out!

[V]
.A       E                     F#m7          D
1Blessed be Your name in the   land that is  plentiful.
2Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me.
.           A               E                      D
1Where Your streams of a____bundance flow, blessed be Your name.||
2When the   world's "all as it should be,"|blessed be Your name.||
.A           E                     F#m7             D
1And blessed be Your name when I'm found in the     desert place;
2And blessed be Your name on the   road marked with suffering;
.               A                E                   D
1Though I       walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name.
2Though there's pain in the      offering,   blessed be Your name.


[P]
.A              E                F#m7             D
 Every blessing You pour out I'll    turn back to praise;
.A                 E              F#m7             D
 When the darkness closes in, Lord,   still I will say:


[C]
.               A           E                     F#m7  D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name;
.               A           E                     F#m7 E    D
 Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your glor_ious name.


[B]
.    A              E        F#m7           D
 You give and take away; You give and take away;
.   A                    E           F#m7            D
 My heart will choose to say, "Lord, blessed be Your name." (2X)


[T]
.     F#m7 E    D
 Your glor_ious name.</lyrics>

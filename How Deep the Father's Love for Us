  <lyrics>[V1]
.    E2                F#m7 E/G# A2
 How deep the Father's love for  us,
.    E               C#m7 B2
 How vast beyond all mea__sure,
.     E2             F#m7 E/G# A
 That He should give His  only Son
.   E                 Bsus E
 To make a wretch His trea_sure.||
.    E                 F#m7 E/G# A
 How great the pain of sea__ring loss;
.    E                C#m7 B
 The Father turns His face away
.   E2                   F#m7 E/G# A2
 As wounds which mar the Cho__sen  One
.      E            Bsus  E
 Bring many sons to glory.

[V2]
 Behold the man upon a cross,
 My sin upon His shoulders.
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
 Call out among the scoffers.||
 It was my sin that held Him there
 Until it was accomplished.
 His dying breath has brought me life -
 I know that it is finished.

[V3]
 I will not boast in anything,
 No gifts no power no wisdom,
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
 His death and resurrection.||
 Why should I gain from His reward?
 I cannot give an answer.
 But this I know with all my heart:
 His wounds have paid my ransom.</lyrics>

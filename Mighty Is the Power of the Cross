[V1]
 What can take a dying man
 And raise him up to life again?
 What can heal a wounded soul?
 What can make us white as snow?||
 What can fill the emptiness?
 What can mend our brokenness,
 Brokenness?

[C]
 Mighty, awesome, wonderful
 Is the holy cross,
 Where the Lamb laid down His life
 To lift us from the fall.
 Mighty is the power of the cross.

[V2]
 What restores our faith in God?
 What reveals the Father's love?
 What can lead the wayward home?
 What can melt a heart of stone?||
 What can free the guilty ones?
 What can save and overcome,
 Overcome?

[B]
 It's a miracle to me.
 (It's a miracle to me.)
 And it's still a mystery.
 (And it's still a mystery.)||
 It's a miracle to me,
 The power of God
 For those who believe.

[C2]
 Mighty, awesome, wonderful
 Is the holy cross,
 Where the Lamb laid down His life
 To lift us from the fall.

[T]
 Mighty is the power of,
 Mighty is the power of,
 Mighty is the power of the cross.</lyrics>

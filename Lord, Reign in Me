  <lyrics>[V1]
.A    Esus         D2    Esus          A
 Over all the earth, You reign on high,
.      Esus           D2      Esus       F#m7
 Every mountain stream, every sunset sky;
.       Esus       D2         Esus     Bm7
 But my one request, Lord, my only aim,
.            D2      Esus 
 Is that You reign in me again.


[C]
.A     E        D2        E             A
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power;
.     E      D2            E            F#m
 Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour,
.    E       D2      E     Bm7
 You are the Lord of all I am,
.             D        E        A (E D F#m7 E D to verse)
 So won't You reign in me again.


[V2]
 Over every thought, over every word,
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord;
 'Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing,
 So won't You reign in me again.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V]
.G                      D
 I will seek You, Lord, while I am in my youth.
.C                       D
 I will trust You, Lord, and I'll proclaim Your truth,
.G                    D
 For You searched and found me while I was far away
.C                    D
 And in my troubled times, you always keep me safe.

[C]
.G                     D
 The Lord is my light and my salvation.
.C                  D
 Whom shall I fear; whom shall I fear?
.G                          D
 The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
.C                  D
 Whom shall I fear; whom shall I fear?

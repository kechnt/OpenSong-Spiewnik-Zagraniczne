.D                 G                   D/A
 Today I finally found a melody that fits,
.               G
 A melody that fits.
.D                 G                       D/A
 Today I finally found a song that I can sing,
.                   G
 A song that I can sing.

 I bow down before You and crown You the King of all Kings.

 I'll sing of Your mercy and how I have been set free.

 I'm set free.

 They'll bow before Your throne.
.D                     G                      D/A
 The nations You have made will worship You alone,

 They'll worship You alone...They'll sing for You.

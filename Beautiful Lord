[V1]
.         A2              C#m           Bsus
 When the storm is raging all around me,
.             A2                    C#m       Bsus
 You are the peace that calms my troubled sea.||
.             A2                  C#m         Bsus
 And when the cares of this world darken my day,
.             A2                    C#m           Bsus
 You are the light that shines and shows me the way.

 Your grace remains the shelter that I seek.||
 And when my weakness is all I can give,
 Your gentle Spirit gives me strength again.

 It's Your mercy that has made me free. (2X)

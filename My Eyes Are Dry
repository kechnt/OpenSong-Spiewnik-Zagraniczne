  <lyrics>[1]
.   A        E       D        A
 My eyes are dry, my faith is old,
.   Bm       F#m      E
 My heart is hard, my prayers are cold;
.    A      E     D        A
 And I know how I ought to be:
. Bm      F#m     E       A
 Alive to You and dead to me.

[2]
.A               D           D   C#m   Bm   A
 Oh, what can be done for an old heart like mine?
.          E               A
 Soften it up with oil and wine;
.           D            C#m Bm A
 The oil is You, Your Spirit of love,
.                E
 Please wash me anew
.       D            A
 In the wine of Your blood.</lyrics></song>

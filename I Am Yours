[V2]              		
 Singing of a love now,
 You taught this broken heart to sing again.
 Every day I'll come, to thank You, oh, to thank You.
 Singing of a life now,
 You taught this wounded soul to live again.
 Every day I'll live to thank You. oh, to thank You, today and every day.

 And if my food is to do Your will
.         C             F/A
 Then I'm hungry, still hungry;
.                Bb                  F/A
 There's so much more that I need to give
.   C             F/A
 To thank You, to thank You.    x2

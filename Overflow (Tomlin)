  <lyrics>[V1]
. G                                   G/F#
 Here I bring my stains and crowns. Gentle river wash me now.
.     Em7                               C2
 Your love is deeper than I know, Your ways higher than I can go.||
. G                        G/F#
 Lead me in Your holiness; I    will follow, I confess.
. Em7                      C2
 Glory is the song I sing. Your life is living me.

[C]
.     Em7          D/F#
 And where would I be
.         G           D7sus/A
 Without You, without You?
. Em7          D/F#    D7sus/A
 Where would I be  without     You?

[V2]
 I will bow before the cross, cherish my Redeemer's cost.
 There is nothing I can do, but only stand amazed by You.||
 Mercy new with ev'ry day, wrapped up in Your arms of grace.
 Nothing more, You're all I need. Your life is living me.

[Instrumental]

[B]
.            Dsus      Em7                   C2   G
 Like a waterfall, You fill my heart and overflow.
.          Dsus            Em7
 Like a candle flame, You light my way
.     C2          G   G/F#         Em7  C2
 And lead me as I go, lead me as I go.

[T]
.  G           Dsus       Em7          C2
 Where would I be without You, without You?
.           G    D/A          Em7    C2
 Spirit overflow;   let me overflow.
.           G    D          Em7    C2
 Spirit overflow;  let me overflow.||
.           G                D
 Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.          Em7               C2
 Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.           G                D/F#
 Let me overflow; let me overflow.
.          Em7               C2
 Let me overflow; let me overflow.</lyrics>

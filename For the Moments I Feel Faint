.E Asus2 C#9 B9

[V1]
.E           Asus2  C#9       B9
 Am I at the point    of no improvement?
.E           Asus2   C#9         B9
 What of the death I still dwell in?
.E        Asus2        C#9     B9 
 I try to excel, but I feel no movement.
.E        Asus2        C#9          B9
 Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?

[C]
.E     Asus2 C#9         B9
 Never under_estimate my Jesus.
.E                      Asus2
 You're telling me that there's no hope.
.    C#9                B9
 I'm telling you you're wrong.
.E     Asus2 C#9         B9
 Never under_estimate my Jesus.
.E                Asus2              C#9            B9
 When the world around you crumbles, He will be strong.

 He will be strong.

[V2]
.E             Asus2 C#9                B9
 I throw up my hands.   "Oh, the impossibilities."
.E              Asus2           C#9       B9
 Frustrated and tired, where do I go from here?
.E                 Asus2              C#9          B9
 Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly.
.E                Asus2    C#9                B9
 Overcoming these obstacles  is overcoming my fear.

[B]
.E                 Asus2  
  I think I can't;   I think I can't,
.C#9             C9
 But I think You can; I think You can.
.E                 Asus2  
  I think I can't;   I think I can't,
.C#9             C9
 But I think You can; I think You can||
.F#9                 Asus2                       E     
 Gather my insuficiencies and place them in Your hands,
.Asus2              C#9 
 Place them in Your hands.
.B9
 Place them in Your hands.</lyrics></song>

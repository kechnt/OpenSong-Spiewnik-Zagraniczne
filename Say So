.Emaj7                                   Dmaj7
 What does it mean to be saved?|Isn't it more than just a prayer to pray,
.A/C#            Dmaj7      Emaj7     
 More than just a way to Hea-ven?    

[P]
.Emaj7                              Dmaj7
 What does it mean to be His?|To be formed in His Likeness,
.                    A
 Know that we have a purpose:
.      C#m                                              D
 To be salt and light in the world, in the world,|To be salt and light in the world! 

[C]
.          E                                    Bm7
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,|Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
.          A                     Dmaj7        E
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, say so, say so! (2X)

[V2]
.Emaj7                                 Dmaj7
 Oh that the church would arise Oh that we would see with Jesus' eyes 
.A/C#              Dmaj7    Emaj7     
 We could show the world heaven    

[P2]
.Emaj7                                Dmaj7
 Show what it means to be His: To be formed in His Likeness
.                      A
 Show them they have a purpose:
.      C#m                                              D
 To be salt and light in the world, in the world, to be salt and light in the world!
.      F#m7                                             D
 To be salt and light in the world, in the world, to be salt and light in the world!

 I    am redeemed, I    am redeemed, I am redeemed, I am redeemed 
.A/C#             D             E
 I   am redeemed, I am redeemed (2X)</lyrics></song>

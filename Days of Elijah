.Bb                         Eb          Bb          F           Bb
1These are the days of E____lijah,|de___claring the word of the Lord,
2And these are the days of Ezekiel,|the dry bones becoming as   flesh;
.    Bb                         Eb             Bb            F         Bb
1And these are the days of Your servant Moses,|righteousness being re__stored;||
2And these are the days of Your servant David,|rebuilding a  temple of praise;||
.    Dm                             Gm           Eb                      F
1And though these are days of great trials,|of   famine and darkness and sword,
2And these are the days of the      harvest,|the fields are white in the world,
.      Bb                      Eb                  Bb          F           Bb
1Still we are the voice in the desert crying,|"Pre_pare ye the way of the  Lord!"
2And   we are Your laborers    in Your vineyard,|declaring the Word of the Lord.

.          Bb                  Eb
 Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
.                 Bb                 F
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
.             Bb                          Eb
 So lift your voice, it's the year of Jubilee,
.                  Bb      F      Bb
 And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

[T]
.    Bb          Ab         Eb    Bb
 Who was and Who is and Who is to come.</lyrics>

.     Am               F
 What wondrous love is this,
.     G          Am
 O my soul, O my soul?
.     Am               F          G
 What wondrous love is this, O my soul?||
.     Am               Dm
 What wondrous love is this
.     F                  G
 That caused the Lord of bliss
.   Am                F            G
 To bear the dreadful curse for my soul,
.   Am                F            G
 To bear the dreadful curse for my soul?

 Wondrous love... (4x)


[V2]
 When I was sinking down,
 Sinking down, sinking down,
 When I was sinking down, sinking down,
 When I was sinking down,
 Beneath God's righteous frown,
 Christ laid aside His crown for my soul,
 Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.


[V3]
 To God and to the Lamb
 I will sing, I will sing.
 To God and to the Lamb, I will sing.||
 To God and to the Lamb,
 Who is the Great I AM,
 While millions join the theme, I will sing,
 While millions join the theme, I will sing.


[V4]
 And when from death I'm free,
 I'll sing on, I'll sing on.
 And when from death I'm free, I'll sing on.||
 And when from death I'm free,
 I'll sing and joyful be,
 And thro' eternity, I'll sing on, 
 And thro' eternity, I'll sing on.

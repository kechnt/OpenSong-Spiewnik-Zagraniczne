.A  C#m  F#m  E  D

[V1]
.E                                         F#m
 I've watched my dreams all fade away, and blister in the sun;
.E                            D 
 Everything I've ever had's unraveled and undone.
.E                                         F#m
 I've set upon a worthless stack, of my ambitious plans
.E                            D 
 And the people that I've loved the most, have turned their backs and ran.

[C]
.A                                C#m 
 This is the good life, I've lost everything
.        F#m            E               D
 I could ever want, and ever dream of.
.A                                C#m 
 This is the good life, I found everything
.        F#m            E               D
 I could ever need, here in Your arms.

[V2] 
.E                                        F#m
 Loneliness has left me searching for someone to love.
.E                           D 
 Poverty has changed my view of what true riches are.
.E                                         F#m
 Sorrow's opened up my eyes, To see what real joy is.
.E                          D 
 Pain has been the catalyst to my heart's happiness.

[B] 
.A                  C#m
 What good would it be
.F#     E   D
 If you had everything,
.A              C#m
 But you didn't have was
.F#m  E   D
 The only thing you need?</lyrics></song>

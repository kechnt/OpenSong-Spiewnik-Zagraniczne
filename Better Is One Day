  <lyrics>[V1]
.    E                             A         B
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,|O Lord Almighty;
.E                                 B
 My soul longs and even faints for You.
.    E                          A           B
 For here my heart is satisfied|within Your presence;
.  E                               B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.
 
 
[C]
.          A
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.          B
 Better is one day in Your house,
.          A
 Better is one day in Your courts,
.               B
 Than thousands elsewhere.
 
 
[V2]
.    E                              A           B
 One thing I ask, and I would seek: To see Your beauty,
.   E                                B
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells. (2X)
 
 
[B]
.C#m7                   B   A                   B
 My heart and flesh cry out for You, the living God,
.C#m7                B      A    B
 Your Spirit's water for my soul;
.C#m7                 B     A                  B
 I've tasted and I've seen, come once again to me,
.C#m7             B      A                        B
 I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You.</lyrics>

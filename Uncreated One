[V1]
 Holy, Uncreated One,
 Your beauty fills the skies,
 But the glory of Your majesty
 Is the mercy in Your eyes.

[C]
 O Great God, be glorified.
 Our lives laid down,
 Yours magnified.
 O Great God, be lifted high.
 There is none like You.

[V2]
 Worthy, Uncreated One,
 From heaven to earth come down.
 You laid aside Your royalty
 To wear the sinners' crown.

[V3]
 Jesus, Savior, God's own Son,
 Risen, reigning Lord,
 Sustainer of the universe
 By the power of Your Word.

[B]
 There is none like You.
 There is none like You.

[V4]
 And when we see Your matchless face,
 In speechless awe we'll stand,
 And there we'll bow with grateful hearts
 Unto the Great I AM.</lyrics>

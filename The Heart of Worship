  <lyrics>[V1]
.E2                   B2
 When the music fades,
.                     F#m7
 All is stripped away,
.                  B7sus
 And I simply come,||
.E2                   B2
 Longing just to bring
.                          F#m7
 Something that's of worth
.                           B7sus
 That will bless Your heart.


[P]
.F#m7           E/G#            B7sus
 I'll bring You more than a song,
.                F#m7             E/G#             B7sus
 For a song in itself is not what You have required.
.F#m7            E/G#       B7sus
 You search much deeper within,  through the way things appear;
.F#m7           E/G#          B7sus
 You're looking into my heart.


[C]
.E2                          B2/D# .
 I'm coming back to the heart      of worship,
.         F#m7         E/G# .    A            B7sus .      
 And it's all about You;    it's all about You,     Jesus;||
.E2                            B2/D# .
 I'm sorry, Lord,|for the thing      I've made it
.          F#m7          E/G# .    A            B7sus .     E
 When it's all  about You;    it's all about You,     Jesus.


[V2]
 King of endless worth,
 No one could express
 How much You deserve;||
 Though I'm weak and poor,
 All I have is Yours,
 Every single breath.</lyrics>

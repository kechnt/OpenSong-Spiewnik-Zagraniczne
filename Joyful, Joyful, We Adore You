.G                D             G                     D
1Joyful, joyful,  we adore You, God of glory, Lord of light;
2All Your works declare Your glory; All creation joins to sing.

.G                  D                 G                    D           G
1Angels lifting     praise before You Sing throughout this holy        night.||
2Praise resounds as earth rejoices    In the birth of      Christ, the King.||

.D         G       D        G       D        G         Em  A     D
1In a      manger  lies a   Baby--  Child of Mary,     Son of    God.
2Shepherds kneel before the Infant. Trumpets sound and an__thems raise

.G                D                  G                   D         G
1Voices joined in joyful chorus      Praise You for Your gift of   love.
2As with joy our  hearts are lifted, Joined in wonder,   love, and praise.</lyrics>

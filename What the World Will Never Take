.A D A D
 
[V]
.A
 With all I'm holding inside
.A                        D
 With all my hopes and desires
.D
 And all the dreams that I've dreamt
.A
 With all I'm hoping to be
.A
 And all that the world will bring
.D                             C#
 And all that fails to compare
 
[P]
.A       B               C#
 You say You want all of me
.A
 I wouldnt have it any other way
 
[C]
.A
 I've got a Saviour and He's living in me
.D
 WHOA!
.F#
 I wana know
.B      D
 I wana know You today
.A
 And You're the best thing that has happened to me
.D                        F#
 And the world will never take
.B                    D
 The world will never take You away
 
[C2]
.A      D                     A
 No-one could ever take You away
 
[Instrumental]

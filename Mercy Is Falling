  <lyrics>[V]
.     D        G
 Your mercy is falling,
.   D           A
 Is falling, is falling
.     D         G 
 Your mercy, it falls 
.         Bm           A
 Like the sweet spring rain;
.     D        G 
 Your mercy is falling,
.   D           A    D 
 Is falling all over me.

[C]
.D           G          A
 Hey-oh! I receive Your mercy!
.D           Bm         A 
 Hey-oh! I receive Your grace!
.D              G        A   D 
 Hey-oh! I will dance forevermore!</lyrics></song>

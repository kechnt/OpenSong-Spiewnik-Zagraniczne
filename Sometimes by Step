.D             A/D                 D              A/D
 Sometimes the night was beautiful. Sometimes the sky was so far away.
.G/B                             Asus            A7                             F#m
 Sometimes it seemed to stoop so close you could touch it, but your heart would break.||
.                 G             F#m                  G               G/B
 Sometimes the morning came too soon.  Sometimes the day could be so hard.
.             A                 G2                    Em7     G/A
 There was so much work left to do, but so much you'd already done.

 Oh God, You are my God,   and I will ever praise You.

 Oh God, You are my God,   and I will ever praise You.||

 I will seek You in the morning,
.           G                     Em7
 And I will learn to walk in Your ways.
.    D                    A/C#     A
 And step by step, You'll lead me,
.           G/B        Asus   A  D     (G/D A/D to verse)
 And I will follow You all of my days.


[V2]
.D           A/D              D                 A/D
 Sometimes I think of Abraham,  how one star he saw had been lit for me.
.G/B                       Asus           A7                F#m
 He was a stranger in this land, and I am that no less than he.
.            G                F#m                 G               G/B
 And on this road to righteousness, sometimes the climb can be so steep;
.      A            G2               Em7         G/A
 I may falter in my steps, but never beyond Your reach.


[T]

 And I will follow You all of my days.
.           Em7                  C    G2
 And I will follow You all of my days.
.    D/A                  A
 And step by step, You'll lead me,
.           G/B        G/A       D     A/D
 And I will follow You all of my days.</lyrics></song>

.G              C       D    G               C      D
 I, the Lord of sea and sky,|I have heard my people cry.
.Em               C             Am           D
 All who dwell in dark and sin,|my hand will save.||
.G              C        D      G                 C        D
 I who made the stars of night,|I will make their darkness bright.
.Em               C              Am           D
 Who will bear my light to them?|Whom shall I send?


[C]
.D      G               Em
 Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
.       G         Am7            D   D7
 I have heard You calling in the night.
.       G               Em
 I will go Lord, if you lead me.
.       G         Am7    D     G
 I will hold Your people in my heart.


[V2]
 I, the Lord of snow and rain,|I have borne my people's pain.
 I have wept for love of them;|they turn away.||
 I will break their hearts of stone,|give them hearts for love alone.
 I will speak my word to them.|Whom shall I send?


[V3]
 I, the Lord of wind and flame,|I will tend the poor and lame.
 I will set a feast for them;|my hand will save.||
 Finest bread I will provide,|till their hearts be satisfied.
 I will give my life to them.|Whom shall I send?</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>.E                      A               E
 Life is good with You, Lord, with You, Lord.
.E                              B
 Life is bad when I'm away from You.
.E                      A               E
 Life is good with You, Lord, with You, Lord.
.E
 Show me the bad and show me the good.
.        B               E
 Help me keep my eyes on You!

.              E
 See I've been thinkin'...'bout my Jesus.
.                                        B
 How He saved me and how He gave me this life above.
.      E
 And I remember...that sacrifice of glory.
.                                          B            E
 How He saught me and how He bought me with His unfailing love -
.
 and now I'm singin':

 I was alone when You met me.
 I was on my own and I had no home.
 I was dark and deep in doubt.
 Then You showed me gentleness and mercy.
 You turned me around; I was lost and now I'm found.
 And now I walk this road again.

.          F
 See I was thinkin'...'bout my situation.
.
 I was wantin' the things that this world brings,
.                          C
 Thinking maybe God wasn't enough.
.        F
 Then it hit me: that sacrifice of glory
.
 Was sent to heal me, so He would lead me,
.         C                     F
 And then show me the love from above.</lyrics></song>

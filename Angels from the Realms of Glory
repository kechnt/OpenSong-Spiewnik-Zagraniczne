  <lyrics>[V1]
. G
 Angels, from the realms of glory,
. C          G         D7        G
 Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
. G                       B7
 Ye who sang creation's story,
. Em  B7  Em     D   A    D
 Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

[C]
. D                 G7       C
 Come and worship,|Come and worship,
. Am            Em  Dsus D   G
 Worship Christ the newborn King!

[V2]
 Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
 Watching o'er your flocks by night,
 God with us is now residing,
 Yonder shines the infant Light:

[V3]
 Sages, leave your contemplations,
 Brighter visions beam afar;
 Seek the great Desire of Nations;
 Ye have seen His natal star:

[V4]
 Saints, before the altar bending,
 Watching long in hope and fear,
 Suddenly the Lord, descending,
 In His temple shall appear:</lyrics></song>

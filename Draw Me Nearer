  <lyrics>[V1]
.     C#m      A            B          E
 I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Your voice,
.       C#m       A       B   
 And it told Your love to me;
.      C#m     A           B       E
 But I long to rise in the arms of faith
.       C#m    A        B
 And be closer drawn to Thee. 
 
[C]
.        C#m  A E B
 Draw me nearer
.      C#m          A         B
 To the cross where Thou hast died;
.        C#m  A E B 
 Draw me nearer 
.        C#m               B
 To Your precious bleeding side.
 
[V2]
 There are great depths of love that I cannot know
 'Till I cross the narrow sea;
 There are heights of joy that I may not reach
 'Till I rest in peace with Thee.

[B]
.C#m                          G#m
 You draw me with Your mercy,|You draw me with Your love.
.C#m                          A       B
 You draw me with forgiveness by Your blood.||
.C#m                          G#m
 You draw me with compassion,|You draw me as a bride.
.C#m                        A        B    
 You draw me closer to Your precious side.
 
[V3]
 Consecrate me now to Your service, Lord,
 By the power of grace divine;
 Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
 And my will be lost in Thine.

[T]
.        C#m  A E B 
 Draw me nearer.</lyrics>

[V1]
 There is an endless song,
 Echoes in my soul;
 I hear the music ring.||
 And though the storms may come,
 I am holding on;
 To the Rock I cling.

[C]
 How can I keep from singing Your praise?
 How can I ever say enough?
 How amazing is Your Love!||
 How can I keep from shouting Your Name?
 I know I am loved by the King
 And it makes my heart want to sing!

[V2]
 I will lift my eyes
 In the darkest night,
 For I know my Savior lives.||
 And I will walk with You,
 Knowing You'll see me through,
 And sing the songs You give.

[B]
 I can sing in the troubled times,
 Sing when I win.
 I can sing when I lose my step
 And fall down again.||
 I can sing, 'cause You pick me up,
 Sing, 'cause You're there.
 I can sing, 'cause You hear me, Lord,
 When I call to You in prayer.||
 I can sing with my last breath,
 Sing, for I know
 That I'll sing with the angels
 And the saints around the throne!

[C2]
 How can I keep from singing Your praise?
 How can I ever say enough?
 How amazing is Your Love!||
 How can I keep from shouting Your Name?
 I know I am loved by the King,

[T]
 And it makes my heart...
 I am loved by the King,
 And it makes my heart...
 I am loved by the King,
 And it makes my heart want to sing!
 Yeah, I can sing!</lyrics>

.A                                                     E
 Bury my head for the shame,|you pick me up, you say I look like you.

 Though it makes no sense to me,|You make me believe that I could trust someone.

 I could ever trust someone,|I could ever trust someone,

 I could ever trust someone,|I could ever trust someone.

 I walk through flame, I touch the fire, 
.                      E 
 You know that I still burn for You.
.F#m
 Flood water, rain crash down, soak the ground,
.        D/F#                               A
 Still I thirst for you. Still I thirst for you.

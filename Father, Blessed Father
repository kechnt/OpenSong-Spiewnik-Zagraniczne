.         F#           C#
 Will you take what we have,
.       F#       C#
 A sacrifice unto you,
.        F#        C# 
 Then create clean hearts
.         F#                C#
 And, Lord, make our spirits new.

 Father, blessed Father,
.         D                 A      E
 Lead and guide us for Your name's sake
.    A              E               D
 And keep us in the shelter of Your presence
.        A        E
 'Til we see Your face.

[V2]
.       F#           C#
 Let us hear what You say.

 Let us know Your voice and all of Your ways.
.         F#            C#
 Take our hands, lead us home
.       F#                          C#
 To the refuge that we find in You alone.

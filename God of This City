.F2                Am
 You're the God of this city.
.                         C
 You're the King of these people.
.                        G           
 You're the Lord of this nation.
.    F
 You are.||
.                    Am
 You're the light in this darkness.
.                       C
 You're the hope to the hopeless.
.                        G
 You're the peace to the restless.
.     F
 You are.

 In this city.||

.       G2                                 Am
 And greater things have still to be done here.

[V2]
 You're the Lord of creation,
 The Creator of all things.
 You're the King above all kings.
 You are.||
 You're the strength in the weakness.
 You're the love to the broken.
 You're the joy in the sadness.
 You are.

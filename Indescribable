[V1]
.Em                                 D/F#         G     D/F# G
 From the highest of heights to the depths of the  sea,
.Am7                       G    F   F(#4)
 Creation's revealing Your majesty.||
.Em                             D/F#        G        D/F# G
 From the colors of fall to the fragrance of  spring,
.Am7                          C/G          F
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings,
.C/E   D/F#
 All exclaiming:

[C]
.G             D
 Indescribable,  uncontainable,
.C2                                                  Em
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by   name.
.G/B            C
 You are amazing  God.||
.G            D
 All powerful,  untameable,
.C                                              Em
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim:
.G/B            C
 You are amazing  God.

[V2]
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go?
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow?||
 Who imagined the sun and gave source to its light?
 Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?
.C/E      D/F#
 None can fathom.

[B]
.Am7      G      F    A# A#/G#
 You are amazing, God.

[C2]
 Indescribable, uncontainable,
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
 You are amazing God.||
 Incomparable, unchangeable,
 You've seen the depths of my heart and You love me the same.
 You are amazing God.
 You are amazing God.</lyrics>

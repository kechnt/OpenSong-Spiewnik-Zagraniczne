  <lyrics>[V1]
 Hope is here
 Shout the news to everyone                                           
 It’s a new day, Peace has come
 Jesus saves
 Mercy triumphs at the cross                        
 Love has come to rescue us
 Jesus saves
  
[V2]            
 Hope is here                         
 What a joyful noise we’ll make
 As we join with heaven’s song
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves
 Raise a shout to let all the world know
 That Jesus saves
 
[V3]
 Free at last
 Every debt has been repaid 
 Broken hearts can be remade
 Jesus saves
 Sing above the storms of life
 Sing it through the darkest night
 Jesus saves
 
[V4]
 Free at last
 What a joyful noise we’ll make
 As we join with heaven’s song
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves
 Raise a shout to let all the world know
 That Jesus saves
 
[V5]
 Sing it out
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves
 Raise a shout
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves
 
[V6]
 You save, You heal
 Restore, reveal, Your Father’s heart to us
 You rose to raise us from the grave
 Your Spirit lives in us
 
[V7]
 Sing it out
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves
 Raise a shout
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves

Em                    D/F#        G You wrote a letter and You signed Your name.Em          D/F#         G       C I read ever word Read it page by page.    Em You said that Youâ€™d be coming.       D/F#   G Coming for me soon.Em    D/F#        C         G Oh my God I'll be ready for You [C].                   C              G ('Cause) I want to run on greener pastures.          D               Em I want to dance on higher hills.          C                  G I want to drink from sweeter waters.       D             Em In the misty morning chill.       C               G And my soul is getting restless.        D             Em For the place where I belong.        C                G          D I can't wait to join the angels and sing my heaven song [V2].  Em                    D/F#     G I hear Your voice and I catch my breath.Em           D/F#        G      C Well done my child enter in and rest.   Em           D/F#         G As tears of joy roll down my cheek .        Em        D/F#      C       G Oh it's beautiful beyond my wildest dreams</lyrics></song>

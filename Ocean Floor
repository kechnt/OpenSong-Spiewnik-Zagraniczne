  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am2               C
 The mistakes I've made 
.            Am2
 That caused pain
.             G
 I could have done without.
.       Dm
 All my selfish thoughts,
.       C                   Dm
 All my pride, the things I hide,
.F
 You have forgot about.

[C1]
.C
 They're all behind you.
.Am2
 They'll never find you.
.G                    C
 They're on the ocean floor.
.     C
 Your sins are forgotten.
.Am
 They're on the bottom
.G            C
 Of the ocean floor.

[V2]
.Am2   C             Am2
 My misdeeds, all my greed,
.        G
 All the things that haunt me now,
.Dm                            C
 They're not a pretty sight to see.
.                   Dm
 But they're wiped away
.     F
 By a mighty, mighty wave,
.  F
 A mighty, mighty wave, yeah!
---
[C2] 
.     C
 Your sins are erased.
.    Am2
 And they are no more.
.        G                C 
 They're out on the ocean floor. 

[B]
.C7sus4     C    C7sus4       C
 Take them away, to return no more.
.C7sus4     C   F
 Take them away to the ocean floor.
.F
 To the ocean floor.
.F
 To the ocean floor.

[T]
.     C
 Your sins are forgotten.
.Am
 They're on the bottom
.G            C
 Of the ocean floor.
.     C
 Your sins are erased
.    Am2
 And they are no more.
.        G                C 
 They're out on the ocean floor.

  <lyrics>[V1]
.    Am                               F
 You thought of us before the world began to breathe.
.    G/B                              C  G/B
 You knew our names before we came to be.||
.    Am                          F
 You saw the very day we'd fall away from you,
.        G/B                       C        G/B
 And how desperately we need to be redeemed.

[P]
.     F           G
 Lord Jesus, come lead us;
.      Dm                 G
 We're desperate for your touch.

[C]
.C                       G
 Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come,
.Dm      Am           F               G
 That you would reign, that you would reign in us.||
.C                           G
 We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice,
.Dm      Am           F               G
 That you would reign, that you would reign in us.

[V2]
 Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh again,
 Come search our hearts and purify our lives.||
 We need your perfect love;
 We need your discipline.
 We're lost unless you guide us with your light.

[B1]
.   G                F         C
 We cry out for your love to refine us,
.       G          F         C     
 Cry out  for your love to define us,
.       G          F        C       Am                         G
 Cry out  for your mercy to keep us|blameless until You return.

[B2]
.  F              C        G
 So reign, please reign in us.
.     Am         F          C         G
 Come purify our hearts; we need your touch.
.     Am                F         C       G
 Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
.       Am                 F          C        G
 So the world may know you reign, you reign in us.</lyrics></song>

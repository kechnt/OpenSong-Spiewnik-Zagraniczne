  <lyrics>[V1]
.C     Em       Am
 Jesus loves me this I know,
.F             C
 For the Bible tells me so.
.C      Em      Am
 Little ones to Him belong,
.F        C         G        C
 They are weak, but He is strong.

[C]
.C         F
 Yes Jesus loves me,
.C         G
 Yes Jesus loves me,
.C         F
 Yes Jesus loves me,
.    C     G        C
 The Bible tells me so.

[V2] 
.C     Em        Am
 Jesus loves me, He who died
.F              C
 Heaven's gates to open wide.
.C       Em    Am
 He will wash away my sin,
.F       C      G          C
 Let His little child come in.

[V3]
.C     Em       Am
 Jesus loves me when I'm good,
.F             C
 When I do the things I should.
.C     Em       Am
 Jesus loves me when I'm bad,
.F    C         G         C
 Even though it makes him sad.

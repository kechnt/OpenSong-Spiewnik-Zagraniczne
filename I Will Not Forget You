  <lyrics>[V1]
.G              G/F#
 Many men will drink the rain
.Em                       C
 And turn to thank the clouds.
.G             G/F#
 Many men will hear You speak;
.           Em             C
 They will never turn around.

[B]
.G
 But I will not forget You
.G/F#
 Are my God, my King.
.Em7                   
 With a thankful heart I
.Cmaj7
 Bring my offering.
.G  
 And my sacrifice is
.G/F#
 Not what You can give
.Em7
 But what I alone can
.Cmaj7
 Give to You.

[C]
.G
 A grateful heart I give,
.G/F#
 A thankful prayer I pray,
.Em7            Cmaj7
 A wild dance I dance before You.
.G
 A loud song I sing,
.G/F#
 A huge bell I ring,
.Em7                Cmaj7           C G Em C G
 A life of praise I live before You.

[V2]
 Many men will pour their gold
 And serve a thing that shines.
 Many men will read Your words;
 They will never change their minds.</lyrics></song>

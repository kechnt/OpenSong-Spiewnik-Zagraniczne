.Badd9                            B7
 Yesterday, I thought I heard you speak to me,
.            G#m
 Giving me a song to sing,
.      C#m                    F#
 And I can't get it out of my head.
.   Badd9                             B7
 So hard to sing the words behind the melody;
.                       C#m
 You're whispering Your heart to me,
.            F#
 But there's no way to speak it.||
.          E
 So go out ahead,
.            G#m
 And lead me on
.                     Bm         F#
 To the places I|have never been before.


[C]
.Badd9                F#
 Let Your glory be my song.
.G#m
 Let it shine on me.
.Bm
 Let it shine on me.
.B                   F#
 Let salvation be my song.
.G#m
 Let it shine on,
.E
 Shine on me.


[V2]
.Badd9                               B7
 You and me - it's beyond my wildest fantasy
.                     C#m
 That You would bring eternity
.        F#
 For the whole world to sing it.

[B]

 I've got a song in my soul and it sings for You. (10x)</lyrics></song>

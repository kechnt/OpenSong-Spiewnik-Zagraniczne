  <lyrics>[V1]
.A          E       F#m
 I've heard all the stories;
.A         E       F#m
 I've seen all the signs,
.A         E       F#m
 Witnessed all the glory,
.A      E          F#m
 Tasted all that's fine.


[C]
.           A     E      Bm           D            A   E Bm
 Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord.
.           A     E      Bm           D            A   E Bm
 Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord.


[V2]
 I see all the people
 Wasting all their time,
 Building  up their riches
 For a  life that's fine.


[B]
.      Bm               D            E   Esus E
 And I find myself just living for today,
.         Bm                D              E     Esus E
 'Cause I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
.      Bm          D                  A          E       G
 So no matter if I rise or fall, I'll never be alone, oh no...</lyrics>

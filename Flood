  <lyrics>[Intro]
.F Eb Cm (x2)

[V1]
.F     Eb             Cm
 Rain, rain on my face.
.F              Cm
 Hasn't stopped raining for days.
.Fm Eb              Cm
 My world is a flood.
.F                 Eb Cm
 Slowly I've become   one with the mud.

[C]
.       F       Eb            Cm
 But if I can't swim after forty days,
.          F           Eb        Cm
 And my mind is crushed   by the crashing waves,
.          F       Eb          Cm
 Lift me up  so high  that I cannot fall.
.          F     Eb
 Lift me, oh woh!

[B1]
.Cm         F Dbmaj7     Eb
 Lift me up   when I'm falling.
.Gm7        F .        Dbmaj7        Eb
 Lift me up   when I'm weak and I'm dying.
.Bb2        F . Dbmaj7          Eb
 Lift me up;  I need you to hold  me.
.Gm7        F .   Dbmaj7           Eb          F
 Lift me up   and keep me from drowning again.

[Instrumental/Ending]
.Db/F  F  Db/F  F  Db/F  F  Db/F  F  Db/F  F  Db/F  F7

[V2]
.F   Eb             Cm
 Downpour on my soul.
.    F            Eb         Cm
 Splashing in the ocean, I'm losing control.
.F    Eb            Cm
 Dark sky all around.
.F     Eb           Cm
 Can't feel my feet touching the ground.

[B2]
;Violin only

 Calm the storms that drench my eyes.
 Dry the streams still flowing.
 Cast down all the waves of sin
 And guilt that overthrow me.</lyrics></song>

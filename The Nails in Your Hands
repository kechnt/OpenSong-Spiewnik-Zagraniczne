  <lyrics>[V]
.    G
 The nails in Your hands,
.    Em
 The nail in Your feet,
.     C                    D
 They tell me how much You love me;||
.    G
 The thorns on Your brow,
.Em
 They tell me how,
.    C                     D
 You bore so much shame to love me.

[P]
.             Bm            Em
 And when the heavens pass away,
.         Bm                 Em
 All Your scars will still remain,
.       Bm             Em               D
 And forever they will say how much You love me...

[C]
.
 And I want to say,
.    G
 "Forever my love,
.   Em
 Forever my heart,
.   C               D      G
 Forever my life is Yours." (2x)</lyrics>

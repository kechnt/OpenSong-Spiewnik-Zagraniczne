.E                                 A       F#7
1There's within my heart a         melo____dy
2All my life was wrecked by        sin and strife;
3Feasting in the riches            of His  grace;
4Though sometimes He leads through waters  deep,
5Soon He's coming back to          welcome me
.B                            E/B  B7
1Jesus whispers sweet and     low:
2Discord filled my heart with pain.
3Resting neath His shelt'ring wing.
4Trials fall across the       way;
5Far beyond the starry        sky.
.E                               A         F#7
1"Fear not I am with thee.       Peace be  still."
2Jesus swept across the          broken    strings;
3Always looking on His           smiling   face:
4Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep;
5I shall wing my flight to       worlds un_known;
.B                      E/B    B7  E 
1In all of life's       ebb    and flow.
2Stirred the slumb'ring chords a___gain.
3That is why I          shout  and sing.
4I see His footprints   all    the way.
5I shall reign with     Him    on  high.

.E             B 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus;
.              B/E E
 Sweetest name I   know.
.               A6 
 Fills my every longing;
.B                E/B B7 E 
 Keeps me singing as  I  go.</lyrics>

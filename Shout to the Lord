.A         E            F#m            E         D
   My Jesus, my Savior,|Lord, there is none like You;
.          A/C#  D            A/E     F#m             G   D/F# Esus  E  D/E
 All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of Your mighty   love.||
.A           E             F#m      E          D
   My Comfort, my Shelter, Tower of refuge and strength;
.          A/C#    D          A/E F#m            G  D/F# Esus E
 Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship You.


[C]
.A            F#m           D             D/E   E
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing,
.A         F#m      D             Esus E
 Power and majesty, praise to the King.
.F#m                        D
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
.       E     F#m     E/G#
 At the sound of Your name.||
.A          F#m        D            D/E   E
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands;
.   A         F#m          D         Esus  E
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand.
.F#m                     D         E       A
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.</lyrics>

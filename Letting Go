  <lyrics>[Intro]
.A  F#m  E  D
 
 
[V]
.  F#m            D          A    E
 I lay all that I am at Your feet.
.  F#m                D                       A   E
 I give You all of my life; I give You all of me.||
.                   F#m  A
 Because of who You are,
.          E                  D
 Because of who You said I'll be,
.                      F#m   A
 Because of all You've done,
.        E                   D
 For the work You've done in me.
 
 
[C]
.          F#m                E                D
 I give my life for what it's worth; I give my soul.
.           F#m      E               D
 I'm giving up every part|that I may hold.||
.              A/C#                 D
 I offer up to You this humble sacrifice.
.            E               D
 I'm letting go; I'm letting go.
.              A/C#                 D
 I offer up to You this humble sacrifice.
.            E               F#m  E  D
 I'm letting go; I'm letting go.

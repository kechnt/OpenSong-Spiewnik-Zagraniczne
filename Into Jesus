.Em
1I see the moon, a million stars are out tonight
2I know You're there, I feel Your love through my despair
.                         D      A
1Gentle reminders         of the way You are
2You speak the words that ease a_way the pain
.Em
1A sea of glass, a raging storm has come to pass
2My heart is free, my eyes are clear, my soul is healed
.                      D     A      
1You show Your face in an ar_ray of ways
2Now that You have     got a hold on me

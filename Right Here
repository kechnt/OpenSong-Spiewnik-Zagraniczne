  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                Am
 All the world is watching.
.C                Am
 All the world does care.
.C                Am
 Even when the world weighs on my shoulder now,
.C                Am
 These feelings I can bear
.F               G
 Because I know that You're here.

[C]
.C                  G
 Everywhere I go, I know You're not far away.
.Am                 F
 You're right here. You're right here. (2X)
.C  Am  C  Am

[V2]
.C                Am
 All these thoughts I've wasted,
.C                Am
 All these thoughts I've feared,
.C                Am
 Even when these thoughts are faded,
.C                Am
 I still know that You hear,
.F                G
 And I can rest my hope in You. 

[B]
.Am                              F
 The many times that I have felt alone,
.Am                              F
 The many times that I have felt the world was crashing down upon me,
.Am                          F
 You always stood here by my side.
.G
 You were always there.</lyrics></song>

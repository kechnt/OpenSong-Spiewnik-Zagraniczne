  <lyrics>[V1]
.  D
 Sing a song of celebration; lift up a shout of praise,
.                         G2                D
 For the Bridegroom will come, the Glorious One.||
.    C2 G2                     D
 And oh,  we will look on His face.
.      C2 G2                   D
 We'll go   to a much better place.


[V2]
.  D
 Dance with all your might; lift up your hands and clap for joy.
.                    G2                 D
 The time's drawing near when He will appear.||
.     C2 G2                       D
 And, oh,  we will stand by His side,
.    C2   G2              Asus  A
 A strong,  pure spotless bride.


[C]
.D         C            G                 D
 We will dance on the streets that are golden,
.               C             G           D
 The glorious Bride and the great Son of Man;
.             C          G         D          C  G
 From ev'ry tongue and tribe and nation will join
.                    D
 In the song of the Lamb.</lyrics>

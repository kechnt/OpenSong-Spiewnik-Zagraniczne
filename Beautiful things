  <lyrics>[V1]
 I wonder if I'll ever find my way
 I wonder if my life could really change
 At all

[V2]
 All this earth
 Could all that is lost ever be found||
 Could a garden come up from this ground
 At all

[C]
 You make beaytiful things
 You make beaytiful things out of the dust||
 You make beaytiful things
 You make beaytiful things out of us

[V3]
 All around
 Hope is sringing up from this old ground||
 Out of chaos life is being found
 In You

[B]
 You make me new You are making me new
 You make me new You are making me new

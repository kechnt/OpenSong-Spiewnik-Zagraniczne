  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                               Amaj7
 You've kept watch over me|since I was a child.
.E                                     B7
 You've stayed close when my heart|has gone running wild.||
.C#m                     Amaj7
 You've welcomed me back|again and again.
.E                    F#m         C#m      D2
 You've offered Your kindness,|forgiven my sin.


[C]
.E                    Amaj7
 You're the source of all the good gifts I know;
.E                B7
 No one else can equal the love You show.||
.E                    C#m
 Though my praise for You often comes so slow,
.Amaj7          B7                  E
 How I long for my life with You to grow.


[V2]
 In Your actions, You show|the proof of Your care.
 In Your presence comes comfort;|You're ev'rywhere.||
 In Your mercy, I find|hope that will last.
 In Your second life,|I am saved from my past.</lyrics></song>

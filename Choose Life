.  E                            C#m                     A                    E  B
1A choice is set before you     now, living or          dying blessing or    cursing;
2  Trust the Lord with all your heart, with all of your soul and all of your be_ing;
.     E                      C#m                      A                        E  B
1And  now the time has come around, to turn from your fighting and rest in His mercy.
2Hold on listen and o________bey, surrender your      life into His            keeping.

 Choose life, that you might live, the life that He gives,

 He gives you forever;
.       E         B           C#m            G#            A
 Choose life, the way that is true, from the One who chose you,
.               B
 Your Father in heaven;
.       E
 Choose life.

[B]
.A                               G#       C#m     B/D#
 And the weight that you're under will be lifted away;
.A                        G#    C#m             B/D#
 And the world will wonder what happened here today;
.           A                     B
 And you'll stand right there and say...</lyrics></song>

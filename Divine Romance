  <lyrics>[V1]
.    F          Am   F         C       G
 The fullness of Your grace is here with me.
.      F        Am      F       C     G
 The richness of Your beauty's all I see.||
.    F            Am      F    C      G
 The brightness of Your glory has arrived.
.         F           Am     F          C     G
 In Your presence, God, I'm completely satisfied.

.     F            C   G
 For You I sing, I dance,
.  F                    C    G
 Rejoice in this divine romance,
.     F             G   Am
 Lift my heart and my hands
.            G                 F
 To show my love, to show my love.


[V2] 
.           F          Am        F     C          G
 There's a deep, deep flood, An ocean flows from You,
.    F          Am              F      C        G
 Of deep, deep love, yeah, it's filling up the room.||
.      F          Am        F        C      G
 Your innocent blood has washed my guilty life.
.         F        Am        F          C     G
 In Your presence, God, I'm completely satisfied.</lyrics></song>

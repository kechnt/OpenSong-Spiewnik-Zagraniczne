  <lyrics>[1]
.             Em
 You shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace,
.    G                            D
 The mountains and the hills will break forth before you.
.            Em
 There'll be shouts of joy and all the trees of the field will
.B7                    Em
 Clap, will clap their hands.

[2]
.            G                       D
 And all the trees of the field will clap their hands (clap clap)
.                            G
 The trees of the field will clap their hands (clap clap)
.                            D
 The trees of the field will clap their hands (clap clap)
.      B7              Em
 While you go out with joy.</lyrics>

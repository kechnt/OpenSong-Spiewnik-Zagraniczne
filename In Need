  <lyrics>[V1]
.           E
 In need of grace.
.           C#m
 In need of love.
.           A
 In need of mercy raining down
.           B
 From high above.||
.           E
 In need of strength.
.           C#m
 In need of peace.
.           A
 In need of things
.          B               E
 That only You can give to me.
 

[C]
.           A                   E
 In need of Christ, the perfect Lamb,
.E                           B
 My refuge strong, the Great I AM.
.           E            B
 This is my song, my humble plea;
.          A      B         E
 I am Your  child,  I am in need.

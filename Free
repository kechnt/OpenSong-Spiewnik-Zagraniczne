  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G Am (3X) C

[V1]
.G           Am
   Turning mole-hills into mountains.
.G          Am
 Making big deals out of small ones.
.G Am
 Bearing gifts as if they're burdens.
.C
 This is how it's been.

[V2]
   Fear of coming out of my shell.
 Too many things I can;t do too well.
 'fraid I'll try real hard and then I'll fail.
 This is how it's been.

[P1]
.A                              Am          D
 'Til the day You pounded on my heart's door.
.A                         Am                 D
 And You shouted joyfully, you're not a slave anymore!

[C]
.G           Am     C
 You're free to dance; forget about your two left feet.
.G         Am           C
 And you're free sing to sing; your joyful noise is music to me.
.G           Am C                                               A
 Free to love,  'cus I have given you my love and it has made you free.

[V3]
    My mind finds hard to believe that
 You'd become humanity and
 Change the course of history
 Because You loved me so.

[V4]
    And my heart cannot understand why You'd
 Accept me as I am, but, you see,
 You've always had a plan and that's
 All I need to know.

[P2]
 So when I am consumed by what the world will say,
 It's then You're singing to me as You remove my chains.

[B]
.F         Am               C          G
 Free from worry, free from envy and denial.
.Am             G           C         A     Am
 Free to laugh, free to give, free to smile.

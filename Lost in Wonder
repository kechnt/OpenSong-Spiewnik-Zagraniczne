  <lyrics>[V1]
.     Bb
 You chose the cross with every breath.
.     Gm7                            Eb2
 The perfect life, the perfect death,
.               Bb   F/A
 You chose the cross.||
.   Bb
 A crown of thorns You wore for us
.      Gm7                        Eb2
 And crowned us with eternal life.
.               Bb   F
 You chose the cross.


[P1]
.     Cm7                      Bb/D        Fsus  F Bb/D
 And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain,
.   Cm7      Bb/D           Fsus  F
 Obedient to death, you overcame.


[C]
.             Bb              Gm7
 I'm lost in wonder. I'm lost in love.
.             Eb2           F
 I'm lost in praise forevermore.
.             Bb         Gm7
 Because of Jesus' unfailing love,
.          Eb2            F
 I am forgiven, I am restored.


[V2]
 You loose the cords of sinfulness
 And broke the chains of my distress.
 You chose the cross.||
 And from the grave victorious,
 You rose again, so glorious.
 You chose the cross.


[P2]
 The sorrow that surrounded You was mine.
 Yet not my will, but Yours be done, You cried.</lyrics>

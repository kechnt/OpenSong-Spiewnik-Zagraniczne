  <lyrics> Now to Him who is able to keep you
 Who is able to keep you from stumbling
 And to make you stnd in the presence
 Of His glory, blameless with great joy.
 To the only God our Father
 Through Jesus Christ our Lord
 Be all glory, majesty, dominion, and power
 For all time now and forever.
 Amen. Amen.
 Amen. Amen.
 Amen. Amen.
 Amen and Amen and Amen.</lyrics></song>

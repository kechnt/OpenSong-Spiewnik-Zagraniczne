[V1]
 Great are You, Lord, mighty in strength.
 You are faithful, and You will ever be.||
 We will praise You all of our days.
 It's for Your glory we offer ev'rything.

[C]
 Raise your hands, all you nations.
 Shout to God, all creation.
 How awesome is the Lord most high.||
 We will praise You together, for now and forever.
 How awesome is the Lord most high.

[V2]
 Where You send us, God, we will go.
 You're the answer; we want the world to know.||
 We will trust You when You call our name.
 Where You lead us, we'll follow all the way.

[B]
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 How awesome is the Lord most high. (2X)</lyrics>

[V1]
.A  
 Let it all out. (Get it all out.)
.       C#m
 Rip it out, remove it.
.      D                                A
 Don't be alarmed when the wound begins to bleed.||
.               A
 Cause we're so scared to find out (what this life's all about),
.   C#m
 so scared we're going to lose it.
.    D                                 A
 And knowing all along that's exactly what we need.

[P1]
.    D 
 And today I will trust you with the confidence
.     F#m             E
 of a man who's never known defeat.||
.    E/G#                   D
 But tomorrow, upon hearing what I did
.       F#m             E
 I will stare at you in disbelief.
.    D            F#m E E/G#       D         E
 Oh, inconsistent me... crying out for consistency.

[C] 
.    A          C#m                 D
 And you said I know that this will hurt,
.F#m            E                      D
 but if I don't break your heart,|then things will just get worse.
.A             C#m               D
 If the burden seems too much to bear,
.          F#m          E           E/G#    D       E      A
 Remember, the end will justify|the pain it took to get us there.

[V2] 
.         A
 And I'll let it be known (at times I have shown)
.C#m
 signs of all my weakness,
.    D                        A
 but somewhere in me there is strength. ||
.    A
 And you promise me (that you believe)
.   C#m
 in time I will defeat this,
.       D                        A
 'cause somewhere in me there is strength.

[P2] 
.    D 
 And today I will trust you with the confidence
.     F#m             E
 of a man who's never known defeat.||
.         E/G#           D
 And I'll try my best to just forget
.     E
 that that man isn't me.

[T] 
.A  F#m  C#m  D 
.      A                              F#m
 Reach out to me, make my heart brand new
.                       C#m      D
 every beat will be for you, for you.
.A                       F#m
 And I know you know you touched my life
.         C#m                                D      A  F#m  C#m  D  E  A
 when you touched my heavy heart and made it light.</lyrics></song>

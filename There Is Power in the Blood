  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                           D         A 
 Would you be free from your burden of sin
.        E                   A                 E        
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
.A                     D       A
 Would you o'er evil a victory win
.        E                      A D A E   
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[C]
.         A      A7     D              A 
 There is power, power, wonder working power
.       E            A   D E 
 In the blood of the Lamb
.         A      A7     D              A
 There is power, power, wonder working power
.       Bm       E            A D A E 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb

[V2]
 Would you be free from your passion and pride
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[V3]
 Would you be whiter much whiter than snow
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[V4]
 Would you do service for Jesus your King
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Would you live daily His praises to sing
 There's wonderful power in the blood</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
 Mountain maker, ocean tamer,
 Glimpses of You burn in my eyes;
 The worship of heaven
 Fills up the skies.

[C]
 You made it all,
 Said let there be,
 And there was all that we see.||
 The sounds of Your voice,
 The works of Your hands,
 You do all things well.
 You do all things well.
 You do all things well.

[V2]
 Star creator, wind breather,
 The strokes of Your beauty,
 Brushed through the clouds;
 Light from the heavens,
 Touching the ground.

[B]
 Imagination runs wild
 And breathes the breath of life
 Across the fields, across the miles...</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
 Joyful joyful we adore Thee
 God of glory Lord of love
 Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
 Opening to the sun above
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
 Drive the dark of doubt away
 Giver of immortal gladness
 Fill us with the light of day

[V2]
 All Thy works with joy surround Thee
 Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
 Stars and angels sing around Thee
 Center of unbroken praise
 Field and forest vale and mountain
 Flowery meadow flashing sea
 Chanting bird and flowing fountain
 Call us to rejoice in Thee

[V3]
 Thou art giving and forgiving
 Ever blessing ever blest
 Wellspring of the joy of living
 Ocean depth of happy rest
 Thou our Father Christ our Brother
 All who live in love are Thine
 Teach us how to love each other
 Lift us to the joy divine

[V4]
 Mortals join the mighty chorus
 Which the morning stars began
 Father love is reigning o'er us
 Brother love binds man to man
 Ever singing march we onward
 Victors in the midst of strife
 Joyful music lifts us sunward
 In the triumph song of life

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                Asus   Bm7 G  D/F#  Em    A         D
 Take my life and let it be| consecr__ated, Lord, for Thee.
.D               Asus   Bm7   G   D/F# Em      A         D   
 Take my moments and my days;|let them flow in ceaseless praise.||
.C2                G/B           Em              Asus   D   
 Take my hands and let them move|at the  impulse of Thy love.
.D                Asus     Bm7 G     D/F# Em    A       D
 Take my feet and let them be| swift and  beautiful for Thee.


[V2]
.D                 Asus   Bm7  G D/F#   Em   A      D
 Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King.
.D                Asus     Bm7 G    D/F#   Em    A       D
 Take my lips and let them be  filled with messages from Thee.||
.C2             G/B         Em                Asus  D   
 Take my silver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold.
.D             Asus    Bm7 G  D/F#  Em  A      D
 Take my intellect and use every  power as You choose.


[C]
.        Em  G        Asus7  A7
 Here am I,    all of me.
.         Em   G              Asus7  A7
 Take my life;   it's all for thee.


[V3]
.D                Asus    Bm7    G  D/F#  Em    A      D
 Take my will and make it thine; it shall be no longer mine.
.D                Asus     Bm7  G  D/F#  Em     A     D
 Take my heart it is thine own; it shall be thy royal throne.||
.C2               G/B          Em                  A      D   
 Take my love; my Lord, I pour at Your feet it's treasure store.
.D               Asus  Bm7  G  D/F# Em    A       D
 Take myself and I will be  ever,   only, all for thee.

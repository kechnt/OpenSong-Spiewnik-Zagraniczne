  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am D/F#      G  Gsus G Am     D/F#        G Gsus G
 Holy    design,          this place in time,
.Am   D/F#    G      D/F#    Em7 Bm/D   C    D
 That I might seek and    find   my   God, my  God.


[C]
.D                 G       D/F#
 Lord, I wanna yearn for You.
.           Em7        G/D  C        D/C        D
 I wanna burn  with passion over You    and only  You. (2X)
.                  G (C2 to verse)   (D/C Em7 to bridge)
 Lord, I wanna yearn.


[V2]
.Am   D/F#      G  Gsus G Am     D/F#        G Gsus G
 Your joy is mine.           Yet why am I fine
.Am   D/F#   G      D/F#    Em7  Bm/D     C    D
 With all my singing    and bringing  grain in light of Him?


[C2]
.D                 G       D/F#
 Lord, I wanna yearn for You.
.           Em7        G/D  C        D/C        D
 I wanna burn  with passion over You    and only  You. (2X)


[B]
.Em7                       C D/C C
 Oh You give life and breath.
.Em7                   C D/C
 In You we live and move.
.       C     Dsus
 That's why I sing:</lyrics></song>

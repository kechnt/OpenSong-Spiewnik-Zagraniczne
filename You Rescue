  <lyrics>;The key is A but I play in G position with the capo on the 2nd fret.

[V1]
.    Em        C      G           D
 Some choices I have made brought pain
.      Em       C       G   D                    C
 But you will never stop restoring what's been lost

[P]
.       D      G   C       D     G
 So I will boast of Your saving deeds
.C     D       Em  C        D  Dsus  D 
 And I will rave of your glory

[C]
.      G           G/B
 You rescue, You redeem
.     C2           D
 You save, You intervene
.      G           G/F#
 You rescue, You redeem
.       Em7     Dsus    D
 Our lives, our stories

[V2]
.      Em    C       G           D
 The damage done to me was not Your dream
.Em     C       G          D            C
 Innocence has died but is risen from the dead

[P2]
.        D     G   C	      D     G
 So I will boast of Your saving deeds
.C     D      Em   C       D    Dsus  D 
 And I will shout of your glory

[C2]
.      G           G/B
 You rescue, You redeem
.     C2           D
 You save, You intervene

 You rescue, You redeem
.      Em7      Dsus    D
 Our lives, our stories</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D        A            F#m7         E7              D
 What to say, Lord? It's   You who gave me life and I
.          A          F#m7          E7           D
 Can't explain just how   much You mean to me now
.                A           F#m7            E7          D
 That You have saved me, Lord.   I give all that I am to You,
.           A       F#m7     E7                     D     A F#m E7
 That everyday I can    be a light that shines Your name.
 

[V2]
 Everyday, Lord, I'll learn to stand upon Your Word
 And I pray that I, that I might come to know You more;
 That You would guide me in every single step I take, that
 Everyday I can be Your light unto the world.

 Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord.

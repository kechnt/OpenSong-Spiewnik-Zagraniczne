.D           G               D
 Come let us worship and bow down,
.             G               D
 (Come let us worship and bow down,)
.D           G               D
 Come let us worship and bow down,
.             G
 (Come let us worship,)
.       Em                                  A           
 Let us kneel before the Lord, our God, our Maker. (2x)

.    G D       A     
 For He is our God,
.    G          Em            A         
 And we are the people of His pasture;
.        G    A       D    Bm
 And the sheep of His hand,
.         G    A       D      
 Just the sheep of His hand.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.            G
 Why are you striving these days?
.            Em
 Why are you trying to earn grace?
.            D                            C
 Why are you crying?  Let me lift up your face.
.                G
 Just don't turn away.


[V2]
.            G
 Why are you looking for love?
.                  Em
 Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough?
.                  D
 To where will you go, child?
.                       C
 Tell me where will you run?
.                   G
 To where will you run?


[C]
.               Em                        C
 'Cause I'll be by your side wherever you fall,
.       G                  D
 In the dead of night, whenever you call,
.    Em                       C                      G
 And please don't fight these hands that are holding you.
.      D                    G   
 Yeah, my hands are holding you.


[V3]
.              G
 Look at these hands and My side.
.                   Em 
 They swallowed the grave on that night
.                         D                        C
 When I drank the world's sin so I could carry you in
.             G                      D
 And give you life. I wanna give you life.


[B]
.      D         Em
 Cause I, I love you.
.       C      D
 I want you to know.
.     D         Em
 That I, I love you.
.     C             D
 I'll never let you go. </lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.G       D/F#  A          Bm  
 You and me were meant to be
.G        D/F#          A     Bm
 A little lower than the angels.
.    G        D/F#  A       Bm
 And on this ground I have found,
.G        D/F#      A    Bm
 Finally found the reason:

[C1]
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 To sing glory,
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 To sing glory.

[V2] 
.G       D/F#  A          Bm  
 I long to walk hand in hand
.G        D/F#          A     Bm
 Down a golden road with Father,
.    G        D/F#  A       Bm
 Where choirs of angels praise His name.
.G        D/F#      A    Bm
 I want to learn:

[C2]
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 To sing glory,
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 To sing glory.
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 And I can't find the words to say,
.        G D/F# A Bm 
 Life gets in the way,
.         G D/F# A Bm 
 Lord, You know my heart's desire.

[B]
.        C                 B            Bb            D
 When it all comes down to who You are, words can not convey.
.        C                 B            Bb               D   D/E D/F#
 When it all comes down to who You are, words get in the way.

[T]
.        C                 B            Bb               D   D/E  D/F#  G 
 When it all comes down to who You are, words get in the way.</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.           G                 G
 Strong and mighty, strong to save us 
.       G              D
 Like a fortress never failing.
.          G                 G
 Strong in battle, strong in kindness,
.        G                             D
 When we stray, Lord, You're strong to find us.

[P1]
.         Em
 When the winds come hard against us,
.        D
 You are steadfast, You are true.
.         Em
 When the ground beneath us trembles,
.                      D
 Your foundation never moves.

[C]
.       G               C
 Strong tower, high and glorious.
.       G                Dsus D 
 Strong tower, mighty in love.
.    G           C
 Our refuge, our defender,
.       G      D     G
 Strong tower, Lord above. 

[V3]
.          G                   G
 Strong to lead us through the shadows. 
.          G             D
 Strong to carry all our sorrows.

[P2]
.        Em
 When the enemy surrounds us,
.        D
 Closing in as darkness falls,
.           Em
 Though his armies rage against us,
.         D
 They can never scale these walls.

[B]
.Em         C           D
 You are my shelter, my shield. 
.            Em     C           D 
 You are the home I could never deserve. 
.            C       G              D 
 Here I will serve, ever under Your gaze. 
.            C           G            D      Dsus 
 Here I will serve, ever singing Your praise.

[T]
.       C      D     G
 Strong tower, Lord above. 
.       C      D     G
 Strong tower, Lord above.</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Gm                       Bb                       
 Staring at a blank wall and all its white washed face 
.C                 Bb
 Not knowing why I had to choose this way 
.Gm        B
 I discern I was wrong in my way 
.C                     B
 Looking for peace in another, another domain 
 
[P]
.Eb            F             Gm
 And I realize that its true I seek you, yes I seek you 
.Eb            F             G
 And I realize that its true I need you, yes I need you 
 
[C]
.G                 B              F                    Eb
 And I reach and I touch you and I know that I need you 
.G                   B              F
 To reach out and to touch me and I know 
.                   Eb
 I know that I need your touch 
 
[V2]
.Gm              Bb     C
 Not knowing why I ever retreated from your arms 
.Bb
 A mistake I made 
.Gm            Bb             C  
 Now oh Lord I feel your warm embrace, contentment 
.         Bb
 fills my soul as joy lights my face
 
[B]
.Dm
 You Look into the sky 
.Dm
 and see His arms of love reaching out for you 
.Dm
 His arms of love and grace 
.Dm
 And you know you need him, you need his touch 
.Dm
 I need your, I need your.....touch</lyrics></song>

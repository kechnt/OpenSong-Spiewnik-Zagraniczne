[V1]
.G5                          D4                 G5
 I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small;
.         Em7                 C2            G5       D4     G5
 Child of weakness, watch and pray, find in Me thine all in all."


[C]
.G5            Em7  G5           D4
 Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
.G5                 C2            G         D4       G
 Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.
.G G/B C G/B Am7 G/B C (2x)

 
[V2]
.G5                          D4              G5
 Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
.    Em7                C2        G5       D4       G5
 Can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.

 
[V4]
.G5                           D4              G5
 And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
.       Em7             C2        G5         D4      G5
 "Jesus died my soul to save,"|my lips shall still repeat.

 
[B]
.   G5             G/B C2
 Oh praise the One who paid my debt,
.G/B Am7(add4)        G/B C2
 And raised this life up  from the dead!
 

[T]
.   G         D4       G
 He washed it white as snow.

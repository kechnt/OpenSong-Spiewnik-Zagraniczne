.A     Gsus2                  D	                      A
 Can I ascend the hill of the Lord, can I stand in that holy place?
.A         Gsus2                   D
 There to approach the glory of my God;
.                A              Em
 Come towards to seek Your face.
.          G                    A     Em
 Purify my heart, and purify my hands,
.              G                      A
 For I know it is on holy ground I'll stand.

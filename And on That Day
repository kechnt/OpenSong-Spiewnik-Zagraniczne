[V]
.           Em              Bm               Am            Em
1           In a little     corner of the    world lived a maiden,
2And as she listened to the voice with her   gaze upon the splendor
3           In a little     time there would be a cele_____bration
.        Bm                Am                D               Em
1Pure in heart, good in    deed, full of     grace, gentle   rose;
2Love em_braced her open   heart, and she conceived the holy Lord.
3Eliza___beth would bear a son, they will    call his name   John.
.        G             D              Am            Em
1An an___gelic salu____tation for the Word's annunciation--
2"Be_____hold the      handmaid, be___hold your     servant,
3He will go before the Lord as a      faithful      messenger
.         G             D           Am       D       Em
1She's to be the chosen mother of   Jesus,   our     Lord.
2Be it    done unto     me ac_______cording  to Your word."
3He'll prepare the      way for the Lamb who is to   come.

[C]
.            Am             G          C              D
 And on that day was put in motion the means of our redemption,
.      Am             G       C       D      Am
 And a way was opened up as a highway to our God;
.                        G          C            D
 And a child was born to us, and to us a Son was given,
.            Am                G             C        D       G
 Through the young and blessed Mary came the greatest Gift of all.

[T]
.G     D     Am     Em      G     D    Am D   Em
 Holy, holy, holy Redeemer, Holy, holy is the Lord;
.G          D      Am       Em
 Blessed is He who comes to free us,
.        G         D            Am   D      Em
 Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord.</lyrics>

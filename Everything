.C#m7    A2    C#m7     A2
 Find me here, speak to me.
.C#m7      A2     C#m7         A2
 I want to feel you, I need to hear you.
.C#m7        A2  C#m7             A2
 You are the light that's leading me
.C#m7   A2   C#m7          A2         C#m7 A2 C#m7 A2
 To the place where I find peace again.

.E   E/G# A2                  C#m7      B  A2
 How can  I stand here with You and not be moved by You?
.E         E/G# A2              C#m7     Bsus  A2        (C#m7 A2 C#m7 A2)
 Would You tell me how could it be  any better than this?

 
[V3]
.C#m7         A2   C#m7              A2
 You calm the storms and You give me rest.
.C#m7        A2          C#m7                A2
 You hold me in your hands, You won't let me fall.
.C#m7         A2  C#m7           A2
 You steal my heart, You take my breath away.
.C#m7              A2 C#m7     A2
 Would you take me in? Take me deeper now?

 You're everything, everything. (4X)</lyrics>

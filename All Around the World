.E                              D       A
 All around the world there's a new day dawning,
.          E                             D        A
 There's a sound coming round, there's a new song rising up,
.D   A                E D A
 Ah, it's a new day!||
.E                         D         A
 Everywhere you go you can hear this story,
.          E                            D          A
 There's a power coming down, there's a glimpse of glory now,
.D   A                E D A
 Ah, it's a new day!

[V1]
.Bm7                        F#m                     E Esus E
 There's a sound of praise, There's a sound of war;
.Bm7                   F#m                 E     
 Lift the banner high, let the Lion roar.
.Bm7                    F#m                E       Esus E
 Can you hear the sound in the tops of the trees?
.F#m                  D                 Bsus B
 Heaven's armies come! Crush the enemy!

[V2]
.E              Esus               E Eses E
 Lift your hands before the King,
.              Esus                 B7sus B E
 The sovereign Ruler of the earth;
.        Esus                  Esus E
 Let the nations come to Him,
.E           Esus               D/A A D/A A
 Let the cry of hearts be heard:
.  D/A  A     D/A  A     D/A  A   Bsus
 Revive us! Revive us! Revive us again!


[V3]
.Bm7                       F#m                    E Esus4 E
 Let the lame run, let the blind see! 
.Bm7                      F#m                     E 
 Let Your power come, set the captives free!
.Bm7                        F#m                   E Esus4 E
 Let the lost return to the Lover of our souls,
.Bm7                   D                     Bsus B
 Let the prodigal find the way back home.

  <lyrics>[V1]
 It's 2 o'clock, your eyes are shut,
 your phone alarm is going off
 The sun is up, you're still in bed,
 another day gone again
 
[V2]
 This isn't what you wanted was it
 I know you've got
 a pulse let's get it started
 
[C]
 You've got one shot,
 all you got take it now
 You gotta get up, get up,
 get up oh-wo-oh-wo-oh
 One life, live it right,
 keep on moving forward
 You've got one shot
 everybody it's your time
 ||
 I wanna see you on the other side
 You've got one shot,
 all you got, live out loud
 Come on wake up, wake up,
 wake up before it's over
 
[V3]
 You got a truck, take a drive
 go somewhere to feel alive
 You got a dream, say a prayer,
 a little faith will get ya there
 
[V4] 
 This is what
 you wanted promise
 Never go back to
 the way you started
 
[B] 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</lyrics></song>

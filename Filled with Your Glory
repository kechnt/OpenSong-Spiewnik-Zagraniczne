  <lyrics>[V1]
.      G                                          D
 In my heart, in my heart,|there's a fire burning,
.                         C                 Am               D
 A passion deep within my soul,|not slowing down not growing cold.||
.     G                                            D
 An unquenchable flame|that keeps burning brighter,
.                               C               Am                  D
 A love that's blazing like the sun|for who You are and what You've done.||
.    C      G       D      Am
 And as the fire is raging on,
.        C      G          D
 So Your praise becomes my song.

[C1]
.          G                                D
 The whole earth is filled|with Your glory, Lord.
.                C
 Angels and men adore;
.                   G         D
 Creation longs for what's in store.||
.        G                   D                        C
 May You be honored and glorified,|exalted and lifted high.
.                    G      D
 Here at Your feet I lay my life.

[V2]
.         G                                          D
 From the ends of the earth|to the heights of heaven,
.                             C                Am                D
 Your glory, Lord, is far and wide;|through history You reign on high.||
.         G                                          D
 From the depths of the sea|to the mountain's summit,
.                              C                Am             D
 Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds;|a higher love cannot be found.||
.   C       G  D        Am
 So let the universe proclaim
.     C               G          D
 Your great power and Your great name.

[C2]
.          G                                D
 The whole earth is filled|with Your glory, Lord.
.                         C
 Mountains bow and oceans roar;
.                   G         D
 Creation longs for what's in store.||
.        G                   D                        C
 May You be honored and glorified,|exalted and lifted high.
.                    G      D
 Here at Your feet I lay my life.

.Em                   C     D              Em C D
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
.Em                    C      D            Em C D
 When at the cross the Savior made me whole. ||
.G                   D/F#
 My sins were washed away,
.       C                   G/B
 And my night was turned to day.
.     Em                   C     D         Em
 When heaven came down and glory filled my soul.


[V1]
.G        D/F#       Em        C
 O what a wonderful, wonderful day,
.G     D/F#              Em  C
 Day I will never forget.
.G          D/F#         Em       C
 When I was wandering in darkness away,
.G        D/F#     Em  C
 Jesus my Savior I met.


[V2]
 O, what a tender, compassionate friend.
 He met the need of my heart.
 Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
 He made all the darkness depart.


[T]
.G         D/F#       Em        C     G D/F#
 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day,
.G    D/F#    Em C
 Yeah, today.
.G              D/F#        Em     C
 And O, what a glorious, glorious day,
.G     D/F#          Em         C
 The day You came, came to save me.
.G         D/F#        Em        C
 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day,
.      G        Em    
 The day You came and You save me.</lyrics></song>

.Am      Em7                 Fmaj9 
   I will  follow You through  green pastures and sing
.Am   Em7           Fmaj9   
   Halleluja to Your   name.||
.Am      Em7                 Fmaj9 
   I will  follow You through   dark disaster and sing
.Am   Em7                Fmaj9 
   Hallelujah through the   pain.

[P]
.                Fmaj9     G            Am
 And even in the shadow of death I will praise You.
.                Fmaj9  G        C G/B
 And even in the valley I will say:

[C]
.C     Fmaj9           C         G/B    Fmaj9 G
 Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my pra_ise.

[V2]
 You are seated on Your throne in heaven and You
 see all of us down here.||
 You have promised you will not abandon and so I
 shall not fear.

[B]
.Am                      G/B
 You made every star, and  you taught it how to shine.
.C                   F2
  You knew my name before there was time.
.        C             G/B           Am          G/B
 And all this was just part  of your glorious design.
.     Fmaj9        G
 Hallelujah,  Hallelujah.

[T]
.C     Fmaj9           C         G/B    Fmaj9 G
 Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my pra_ise.
.C     Fmaj9           C         G/B    Am  Em7 F
 Holy, My God, You are worthy of all my praise.
.Am Em7 F x3

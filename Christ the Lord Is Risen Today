[V2]
 Lives again our glorious King, alleluia!
 Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!
 Dying once He all doth save, alleluia!
 Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!

[V3]
 Love's redeeming work is done, alleluia!
 Fought the fight, the battle won, alleluia!
 Death in vain forbids Him rise, alleluia!
 Christ has opened Paradise, alleluia!

[V4]
 Soar we now where Christ has led, alleluia!
 Foll'wing our exalted Head, alleluia!
 Made like Him, like Him we rise, alleluia!
 Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, alleluia!

[V5]
 Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, alleluia!
 Christ hath burst the gates of hell, alleluia!
 Death in vain forbids His rise, alleluia!
 Christ hath opened Paradise, alleluia!

  <lyrics>[V1]
.               G            C            D
 Who taught the sun where to stand in the morning?
.             G             C              D
 Who told the ocean you cna only come this far?
.C              B                       C
 Who showed the moon where to hide 'til evening?
.G                     C               D
 Whose words alone can catch a falling star?

[C1]
.           G      C          D
 Well, I know my Redeemer lives.
.     C           B     C
 I know my Redeemer lives.
.                   D
 All of creation testify;
.    B              C
 His life within me cries.
.            D      G     C D
 I know my Redeemer lives.

[V2]
 The very same God that spins things in orbit,
 He runs to the weary, the worn and the weak.
 And the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken,
 They conquered death to bring me victory.

[C2]
 Now, I know my Redeemer lives.
 I know my Redeemer lives.
 Let all creation testify;
 Let this life within me cry.
 I know my Redeemer, He lives...

[B]
.   C            D
 To take away my shame.
.       Em       C              D
 And He lives forever; I'll proclaim
.         B              C
 That the payment for my sin
.        B                C
 Was the precious life He gave,
.        G 
 But now He's alive and
.C                  D   D E
 There's an empty grave!

[C3]
.       A         D      E
 Now, I know my Redeemer lives.
.  D         C#     D
 I know my Redeemer lives.
.                       E
 Let all creation testify;

 Let this life within me cry.
.     D      E          A
 I know my Redeemer, He lives.
.     A      D          E
 I know my Redeemer, He lives.</lyrics></song>

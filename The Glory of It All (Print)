  <lyrics>[V1]
.A      C#m           E                   E/G# E/B
 At the start,|He was there, He was there.
.A      C#m           E                     E/G# E/B
 In the end,|He'll be there, He'll be there.||
.D2(no3)   A/C#               A              E/G#
 And after all our hands have wrought,|He forgives.

[C]
.                    D              E
 Oh, the glory of it all is He came here
.                     D                E
 For the rescue of us all, that we may live,||
.                    D                        E/G#
 For the glory of it all, oh, the glory of it all.

[V2]
.A      C#m            E                    E/G# E/B
 All is lost;|find Him there, find Him there.
.A     C#m            E                    E/G# E/B
 After night,|dawn is there, dawn is there.||
.D2(no3)   A/C#       A          E/G#
 And after all falls apart,|He repairs, He repairs.

[C2]
.                    D              E
 Oh, the glory of it all is He came here
.                     D                E
 For the rescue of us all, that we may live.||
.                    D              E
 For the glory of it all, oh, He is here
.                         D                 E
 With redemption from the fall, that we may live,||
.                    D                        E
 For the glory of it all, oh, the glory of it all,
.                D2/F#                    E/G#
 The glory of it all, oh, the glory of it all.

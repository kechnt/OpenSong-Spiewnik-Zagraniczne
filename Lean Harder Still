  <lyrics>[V1]
 When the battle is great
 And the foes are many,
 Think on My promises;
 I'm the hand that catches your fall.||
 When darkness surrounds
 And guilt wells up in your soul,
 Think on My grace;
 I'm the One who paid for it all.
 
[C]
 Lean harder still, harder on Me.
 Lean harder still, harder on Me.
 Faith is the substance of all things hoped for,
 The evidence of things not seen.
 So lean harder still, for those who wait on Me
 Will never be ashamed.

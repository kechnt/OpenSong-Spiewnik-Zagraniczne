  <lyrics>[V1] 
. E    B  A   E  B A	   E	   B   A   D   B
 I'm so very ordinary, nothing special own my own.
.    E      B  A  E   B A
 Oh, I have never walked on water
.    E      B A   D        B
 and I have never calmed a storm.||
.               E     A             C#m         B      
 Sometimes I'm hiding away from the madness around me 
.       E       A              B
 like a child who's afraid of the dark.

[C1]
.    	          E                     B
 But when I call on Jesus, all things are possible.
.     A               E      B
 I can mount on wings like eagles and soar.
.               E                    B
 When I call on Jesus, mountains are gonna fall
.            A               E        A       B          E     
 'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue me when I call.||
.      C     D        E
 La la laaaa laaaa la.
.      C     D        E
 La la laaaa laaaa la.

[V2]
.E       B  A    E       B  A
 Weary brother, broken daughter,
.E                B  A   D          B
 Widowed, widowed lover you're not alone.
.          E          A                C#m  B     
 If you're tired and scared of the madness around you,
.        E              A               B
 If you can't find the stength to carry on...

[C2]
.    	       E                    B
 When you call on Jesus, all things are possible.
.     A                  E              B
 You can mount on wings like eagles and soar.
.                   E                    B
 When you call on Jesus, mountains are gonna fall
.            A               E        A       B                
 'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue you when you...

[B]
.Em               A
 Call Him in the mornin'. 
.Em           A
 In the afternoon time,
.Em          A                    B
 Late in the evening, He'll be there.
.Em                  A
 When your heart is broken,
.Em               A
 And you feel discouraged,
.Em             A               B            C#
 You can just remember that He said He'll be there.

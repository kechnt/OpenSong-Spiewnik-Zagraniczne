.Em7    F2  F        G         C/E     F   C
 All my days, I will sing this song of gladness,
.Em7     F2    F       G        C/E  F
 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights.||
.   Dm7 Fmaj7 G                 F     C/E G
 For in my    helplessness, You heard my  cry,

 And waves of    mercy poured down on my life.

 Beautiful Savior, Wonderful Counselor,

 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history,

 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer.
 I will sing of the Lamb that never fails,||
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience clear,
 Of death defeated, and life without end.

 And the voices of nations sing, "Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!"||

 You are worthy, beautiful, Risen One.</lyrics></song>

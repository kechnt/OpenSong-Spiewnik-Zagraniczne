.G          D                  Em 
 You are my Strength when I am weak,
.            G               C
 You are the Treasure that I seek;
.           G   D  G   D
 You are my All in All;

 Seeking You as a precious Jewel,
.              G           C
 Lord, to give up I'd be a fool;
.           G   D  G
 You are my All in All.

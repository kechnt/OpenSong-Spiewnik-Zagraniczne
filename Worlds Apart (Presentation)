  <lyrics>[V1]
 I am the only one to blame for this.
 Somehow it all ends up the same.
 Soaring on the wings of selfish pride,
 I flew too high and like Icharus I collide.

[B1]
 With a world I try so hard to leave behind,
 To rid myself of all but love, to give and die.

[V2]
 To turn away and not become
 Another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves
 More deeply than the oceans, more abundant than the tears
 Of a world embracing every heartache.

[B2]
 Can I be the one to sacrifice
 Or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow?

[C1]
 (To love you)  Take my world apart.
 (To need you)  I am on my knees.
 (To love you)  Take my world apart.
 (To need you)  Broken on my knees.

[V3]
 All said and done I stand alone
 Amongst remains of a life I should not own.
 It takes all I am to believe
 In the mercy that covers me.

[B3]
 Did you really have to die for me?
 All I am for all you are|because what I need
 And what I believe are worlds apart.
 And I pray...

[C2]
 (To love you)  Take my world apart.
 (To need you)  I am on my knees.
 (To love you)  Take my world apart.
 (To need you)  Broken on my knees.
 On my knees.

[B4]
 I look beyond the empty cross,
 Forgetting what my life has cost.
 I wipe away the crimson stains
 And all the nails that still remain.||
 More and more I need you now.
 I owe you more each passing hour.
 The battle between grace and pride
 I gave up not so long ago.||
 So steal my heart and take the pain
 And wash the feet and cleanse my pride.
 Take the selfish, take the weak,
 And all the things I cannot hide.||
 Take the beauty, take my tears,
 My sinful, soil'd heart, make it pure.
 Take my world, it all is yours.
 Take it now, take it now.

[C3]
 (To love you)              | To serve the ones that I despise,
 Take my world apart        | Speak the words I can't deny,
               (To need you)| And watch the world I used to know
 I am on my knees           | Fall to dust and blow away.||
         (To love you)      | I look beyond the empty cross,
 Take my world apart        | Forgetting what my life has cost.       
               (To need you)| So wipe away the crimson stains
 Broken on my knees         | And all the nails that still remain.||        
           (To need you)    | And steal my heart and take the pain,
                              And take the selfish, take the weak,
 (To need you)              | And all the things I cannot hide.   
                              Take the beauty, take my tears,||
 On my knees   (To need you)| Take my world apart.
                              Take my world apart.
 (To need you)              | And I do pray,
                              And I pray, and I pray,
 On my knees
                              Take my world apart.

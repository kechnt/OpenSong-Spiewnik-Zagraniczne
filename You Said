.A/D E      F#m7        E            A   E        F#m7 E/G#
 You said, "Ask and you will receive whatever you need."

 You said, "Pray and I'll hear from heaven,
.A/D E              F#m7  E A/D E F#m7 E/G# A/D E F#m7 E/G#
 And I'll heal your land."

.A/D E         F#m7       E
 You said Your glory will fill the earth,
.A/D  E         F#m7 E/G#
 Like water the sea;
.A/D E      F#m7         E
 You said, "Lift up your eyes;

 The harvest is here, the kingdom is near."

.           A       E             F#m7       D
 You said,|"Ask and I'll give the nations to you."
.  A E               D         E
 O Lord, that's the cry of my heart.
.A       E              F#m7         D
 Distant shores and the islands will see
.     A E         D        E  A/D E F#m7 E/G# A/D E F#m7 E/G#
 Your light as it rises on us.

[T]

.A E F#m D

[V]
.A                      E
 Better than the riches of this world
.F#m                      D
 Better than the sound of my friend's voices
.A                       E
 Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
.F#m                 D
 And that's just the start||
.A                          Bm7
 Better than getting what I say I need
.F#m                    D
 Better than living the life that I want to
.A                           E
 Better than the love anyone could give
.F#m7      D
 Your love is

[P]
.    A       Bm7         A/C#
 You hold me now in Your arms
.    D            E F#m D
 And never let me go

[C]
.A                    E
 You oh Lord make the sun shine
.             F#m7               D
 And the moon light in the night sky
.    A                  E
 You give me breath and all Your love
.  F#m                    D
 I give my heart to You because

[T]
.A               E
 ***I can't stop falling in love with You
.F#m                D                    A
 ***I'll never stop falling in love with You

[v1]
 C                 F                   C
 O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
                        G              C
 It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
.C                     F              C
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining
.         Em             B7            Em
 Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
.  G                  C
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
.   G                C
 For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
.Am            Em       Dm             Am
 Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
.  C  G    C  F
 O night divine
.  C   G                C
 O night when Christ was born
.  G       C Dm   C    G           C
 O night, O holy night, O night divine

[V2]
 Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
 With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
 So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
 Here came the wise men from Orient land
 The King of Kings, lay thus in lowly manger
 In all our trials born to be our friend
 He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger
 Behold, your king
 Before Him lowly bend
 Behold, your king before Him lowly bend

[V3]
 Truly He taught us to love one another
 His law is love, and His gospel is peace
 Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
 And in His name all oppression shall cease
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
 Let all within us praise His holy name
 Christ is the Lord, O praise His name forever
 His power and glory ever more proclaim</lyrics>

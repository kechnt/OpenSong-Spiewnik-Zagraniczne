.F    C  F     C       F     F    Dm F     Bb  C  F
 Once in royal David's city,|stood a lowly cattle shed
.F     C F      G        C F   F Dm F      Bb  C   F
 Where a mother laid her baby,|in a manger for His bed
.Bb   F        C      F     Bb    F          Bb C   F
 Mary was that mother mild,|Jesus Christ her little child

[V2]
.F  C    F       C          F       F   Dm F       Bb   C  F
 He came down to earth from heaven,|who is God and Lord of all
.F   C   F       G     C  F    F   Dm  F      Bb  C   F
 And His shelter was a stable,|and His cradle was a stall
.Bb       F        C        F      Bb       F         Bb C    F
 With the poor and mean and lowly,|lived on earth our Saviour holy

[V3]
.F   C       F       C        F          F  Dm    F      Bb  C  F
 And through all His wondrous childhood,|He would honour and obey
.F    C   F         G     C F     F  Dm    F      Bb   C  F
 Love and watch the lowly mother,|in whose gentle arms He lay
.Bb        F        C          F   Bb     F        Bb   C  F
 Christian children all should be,|kind, obedient, good as He

[V4]
.F   C  F      C           F        F   Dm F        Bb C  F
 For He is our childhood's pattern,|day by day like us He grew
.F  C   F       G        C   F     F     Dm  F           Bb C  F
 He was little, weak and helpless,|tears and smiles like us He knew
.Bb     F         C       F        Bb     F         Bb  C   F
 And He feels for all our sadness,|and He shares in all our gladness

[V5]
.F   C   F       C          F        F       Dm  F     Bb C    F
 And our eyes at last shall see Him,|through His own redeeming love
.F   C    F        G        C   F   F  Dm  F       Bb     C  F
 For that Child so dear and gentle,|is our Lord in heaven above
.Bb     F         C        F   Bb     F           Bb C  F
 And He leads His children on,|to the place where He is gone

[V6]
.F   C  F         C     F       F    Dm  F    Bb  C    F
 Not in that poor lowly stable,|with the oxen standing by
.F  C     F       G      C  F    F   Dm F           Bb   C  F
 We shall see Him but in heaven,|set at God's right hand on high
.Bb        F        C      F      Bb          F           Bb C  F
 There His children gather round,|bright like stars, with glory crowned</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                        C 
 I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain 
.D                   G      B7 
 Just to be with the one he loves.
.Em                    C 
 How many times has he broken that promise -
.D                 G 
 It has never been done.

[P1]
.           C                   G               C                       D
 I've never climbed the highest mountain,|but I walked the hill of Calvary...

[C]
.        G                       D 
 Just to be with you, I would do anything;
.           C                 G   D 
 There's no price I would not pay.
.        G                         D 
 Just to be with you, I would give everything;
.        C            Em   D 
 I would give my life away.

[V2]
 I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean
 Just to be with the one he loves.
 Well all those dreams are an empty emotion -
 It can never be done.

[P2]
 I never swam the deepest oceans,|but I walked upon the raging sea...

[B]
.      Bm                                 Em 
 And I know that you don't understand the fullness of my love,
.      C                            G 
 How I died upon the cross for your sins.
.      Bm                              Em 
 And I know that you don't realize how much I gave you,
.      C                          D 
 And I promise I would do it all again.

[CEnd]
 Just to be with you, I've done everything;
 Theres no price I did not pay.
 Just to be with you, I gave everything;
 Yes, I gave my life away.
 I gave my life away.</lyrics>

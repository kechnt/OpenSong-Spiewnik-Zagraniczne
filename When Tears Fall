  <lyrics>[V1]
.         A                 B       C#m
 I've had questions without answers.
.A                  C#m          B 
 I've known sorrow. I have known pain. 
.A                    B          C#m
 But there's one thing that I'll cling to: 
.A                 C#m           B 
 You are faithful. Jesus, You're true. 

[C]
.A                  E             B      A
 When hope is lost,|I'll call You Savior. 
.     A               E             B      A
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You Healer. 
.A                   E             B              C#m
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart. 

[V2]
.       A        B      C#m
 In the lone hour of my sorrow, 
.A                   C#m         B
 Through the darkest night of my soul, 
.A              B            C#m
 You surround me and sustain me,
.A            C#m    B
 My Defender, forevermore. 

[B]
.A                     B       E          A
 And I will praise You, I will praise You.
.A                    B            E           A
 When the tears fall, still I will sing to You. 
.A                     B       E          A
 And I will praise You, Jesus, praise You. 
.A                     B             E    A
 Through the suffering, still I will sing.</lyrics></song>

.E           B/E         A/E             E
 Sing to the King who is coming to reign.
.         B/E       A/E           E
 Glory to Jesus the Lamb that was slain.
.            B/E        A/E                E
 Life and salvation His empire shall bring,
.           B/E         A/E        E
 And joy to the nations when Jesus is King.


[C]
.E
 Come let us sing a song,
.  F#m7                        A2
 A song declaring we belong to Jesus;
.          E      D2
 He is all we need.
.E
 Lift up a heart of praise,
.F#m7                             A2
 Sing now with voices raised to Jesus;
.            E
 Sing to the King.


[V2]
.E         B/E        A/E               E
 For His returning we watch and we pray.
.           B/E       A/E          E
 We will be ready the dawn of that day.
.              B/E          A/E              E
 We'll join in singing with all the redeemed,
.             B/E           A/E       E
 'Cause Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.F#m              D
 What things were gain to us
.F#m                  E
 We count them all as loss.
.F#m            D
 Our pride, the things we've done,
.F#m                         E
 They're rubbish and they're dross.||
.F#m                    D
 That we might know you fully,
.F#m                  E
 And be found in only You.
.F#m                     D
 Our righteousness isn't from the law;
.F#m                        E
 It's Your Son that made us new.
 
[P]
.D            F#m     A                   E
 That we may know|the power of Your resurrection.
.D           F#m  A                   E        D
 Not that we have|already attained perfection,
.D
 But one thing we do:
 
[C]
.A
 Forgetting those things which are behind,
.E                                       F#m
 We reach forward for the upward call of Christ.
.            E
 The call of Christ.||
.A
 Lord, strip us of what we hold dear,
.E                                             F#m
 The worldly things that will never compare to You.
.           E
 Compare to You.
 
[V2]
 Where lies your confidence?
 In what do you place worth?
 Only when you share His death
 Will faith, to you, give birth.||
 Suffer with Him, know His power,
 Press on toward the goal.
 His righteousness will hold you true,
 His call is to be whole!

[B]
.A
  So eagerly we wait
.F#m
  For Christ the Son to come;
.E
  Our citizenship is found
.D
  In heaven.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em            C2(no3)
 I was sure by now
.                           G
 God You would have reached down
.              D/F#
 And wiped our tears away
.                Em7
 Stepped in and saved the day
.          C2(no3)        G
 But once again I'll say Amen
.                  D
 And it's still rainin'

[P]
.Am                      C2(no3)
 As the thunder rolls, I barely hear You whisper
.            Em         Dsus    D
 Through the rain I'm with You
.    Am                        C2(no3)
 And as Your mercy falls,  I'll raise my hands
.                         G              D
 And praise the God who gives and takes away

[C]
.Em                          C2(no3)
 And I'll praise You in this storm
.                    G
 And I will lift my hands
.                    D                     Em
 For You are who You are no matter where I am
.                      C
 And ev'ry tear I've cried
.                  G                     D/F#
 You hold in Your hand You never left my side
.                        Am
 And though my heart is torn
.C2(no3)                     G    Bm7
 I will praise You in this storm
---
[V2]
 I remember when
 I stumbled in the wind
 You heard my cry to You
 And raised me up again
 But my strength is almost gone
 How can I carry on
 If I can't find You

[B]
.Am7
 I lift my eyes unto the hills
.C
 Where does my help come from
.G
 My help comes from the Lord
.    Bm7
 The Maker of heaven and earth</lyrics></song>

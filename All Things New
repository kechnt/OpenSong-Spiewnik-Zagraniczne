;Fingerpicking

[V1]
.G                               C
 Blue skies that take me back to being a child.
.G                               C
 Trees with leaves that turn the colors I love.
.G                              C
 A heart that's beating to Your melodies ringing...||
.Am*        C                           D
 And I am a miracle, 'cause heaven is a part of me,
.C
 And You are the song that I'm singin'.||

;End fingerpicking and start strumming

.G            C
 I was created to love You.
.G            C
 I was created to need You, oh.
.G            C              Am*
 I was created to know You, yeah.||
.           C                           D
 And I am a miracle, 'cause heaven is a part of me,
.C
 And You are the air that I'm breathin'.

[C]
.C  Dsus             C       G           A7sus4
  Because of who You are and who I am in You,
.         C          G
 You make all things pure.
.C  Dsus             C       G           A7sus4
  Because of who You are and who I am in You,
.         C          G          A7sus4
 You make all things true. Oh,  You make all things new!

[B]
.           C		         Am	
 And I'm so thankful for this life that I know;
.C                          Am
 That I am no longer what I was.
.	     C
 Because of Your love
.	            Am
 And the beauty of the cross,
.      C
 I can see Your work in me!||
.G Dsus       C    G           A7sus4 C  G
   All things new,  all things new    in me.
.C Dsus       C    G           A7sus4 C  G
   All things new,  all things new    in me.</lyrics></song>

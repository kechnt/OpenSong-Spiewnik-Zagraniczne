.G                 D
 The lights go on, another game day.
.  Em                        C
 I grabbed my bat and headed for the plate.
.        G                 D               Em
 But the first pitch was a curve and I was done - strike one.||
.          G                         D
 I stepped outta the box, looked the pitcher in the eye.
.          Em                  C
 You could read his lips, "Hey punk, you're mine."
.     G                          D                      Em               (Em D Em)
 So I gave him a wink and said, "Let's see what you can do" - strike two.

[C]
.              C          Em          D                     G
 Gotta keep my eye on the ball, swing straight and true and follow through,
.C        Em                  D    (D D D/G D)
 Don't be afraid whatever the call,||
.              C     Em
 Because we're never alone,
.    D                 G
 Our Coach is there to cheer us on.
.              F#   G        F#         G
 Well it's the wind up, here comes that ball.
.          Em                                  C     D
 You gotta pray and swing, watch it 'till it's goin' goin' it's gone.

[C2]
.G  D Em C G D  Em
 Home home home run.
.           Em   D
 (We need a home run)
.G  D Em C G D  Em
 Home home home run.
.           Em   D
 (We need a home run)

[V2]
.         G                  D
 You know life can be like a baseball game;
.Em                         C
 We're on the same team but we're not all the same.
.       G                D             Em       (Em D Em Em D)
 That's why we've got to learn to play together.||
.         G                 D
 I didn't join this team to sit on the bench.
.Em              C
 I'm goin' deep, swingin' for the fence.
.G                     D                Em   (Em D Em Em D)
 I got some friends on base I gotta get home.

[B]
.Em                                        C
 We are not the first to play this game or stand over this plate.||
.Em                               C
 We are surrounded by the legacy, like they're sittin' in the stands.
.C                                           Em  C  Em  G   D
 I can see them wavin' their hands, sayin', "Go ,go all the way!"

[T]
 Come on now
 Home home home run hey it's gone gone now
 Home home home run hey it's our home run

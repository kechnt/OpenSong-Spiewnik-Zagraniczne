  <lyrics>[V1]
.C
 I can't do anything, I can't do anything without You.
.G7
 But You can do anything, You can do anything You want.||
.C
 And I just can't belive, I can't belive that You would love me,
.G7
 After everything, after everything I've done.


[C]
.              Dm                 C
 And I want to love You, love You more than life itself
.              F              C
 And I want to hold You, even though You can't be held,
.               Am                     D7
 Because You're so much more than everything I've ever known,
.   Fm        C
 Anything, anything.


[V2]
.C
 I'd give anything, I would give anything to hold You.
.G7
 I want to live for You, for You alone I want to live.||
.C
 When I see Your face, I would do anything to know You.
.G7
 You gave everything, You gave everything to give.

 Halle, Hallelujah,

 Halle, Hallelujah,

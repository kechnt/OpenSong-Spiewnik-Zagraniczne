[V1]
.         F#m7                       D                   F#m7                  D
 And if I told you that somebody did love you, would you say|"Hey show me that face;"
.         F#m7                           D                 F#m7                      D
 And if I told you that true freedom was actual, would you say|"Hey, take me to that place?"||
.       F#m7              D         F#m7               D
 And if I said there is a family: a body that moves as one;
.F#m7                              D
 Do you feel the love that invites us, the liberty excites us,
.    F#m7             D               G
 The disco has just begun, has just begun.

.        D                      G                   D                    G
 Give me love, give me liberty, disco: a place everybody in the family's found;
.             D                    G                       D              G
 On that day, we will all be happy people, when love, liberty, disco's in town.
.F#m D F#m D

[V2]
.          F#m7                       D                    F#m7                     D
 And as we step into the light of the Lover, we're all the same, there's no rich or poor;
.        F#m7                                   D
 And you know it's never been good for a man to be alone,
.           F#m7                   D                 G
 So come on in, your name's on the door, what are we waiting for?

[B]
.Bm       A                 G            F#m                 D
  All our fears are turning 'round, fall down, and meet your Maker,
.          A                   G              F#m                 D
 Where our true selves will be found, calling out to every lonely soul.</lyrics>

.     Dm      A        Dm 
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen;  
.    Bb             A 
 Let nothing you dismay   
.  Dm       A         Dm 
 Remember Christ our Savior   
.    Bb                A 
 Was born on Christmas Day   
.   Gm                F       Dm
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
.     Bb             C7  
 When we were gone a-stray  

[C]
.  F          A           Dm  
 O tidings of comfort and joy,
.             C 
 Comfort and joy! 
.C7  F          Dm  A      Dm
 O   tidings of comfort and joy  

[V2]
.   Dm     A       Dm 
 In Bethlehem, in Israel,
.     Bb               A 
 This blessed Babe was born, 
.     Dm      A    Dm 
 And laid within a manger 
.  Bb              A 
 Upon this blessed morn; 
.    Gm       F      Dm
 Of which His Mother Mar-y 
.    Bb              C7  
 Did nothing take in scorn.

[V3]
.      Dm      A       Dm 
 From God our heav'nly Father, 
.  Bb            A 
 A blessed angel came; 
.     Dm    A     Dm 
 And unto certain shepherds 
.        Bb             A 
 Brought tidings of the same; 
.     Gm           F       Dm
 How that in Bethlehem was born 
.    Bb            C7  
 The Son of God by name.</lyrics></song>

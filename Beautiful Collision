  <lyrics>;CAPO 4 - Tune to Eb

[V1]
.Em7                  Cmaj7                    Em7         
 The breaking makes a sound|I never knew could be
.                 Cmaj7                 Em7    Cmaj7
 So beautiful and loud. Fury filled and we collide.

[V2]
.Em7                 Cmaj7                Em7
 So courageous until now, fumbling and scared.
.                         Cmaj7                     G
 So afraid You'll find me out, alone here with my doubt.

[C]
.G        D/F#                     Am7
 Here it comes; a beautiful collision
.        Cmaj7
 Is happening now.
.G          D/F#
 There seems no end to where you begin
.  Am7      Cmaj7       Em7     Cmaj7
 And there I am now you and I collide.

[V3]
.Em7                   Cmaj7               Em7 
 Something circling inside.|Spaciously you fly,
.             Cmaj7                   Em7   Cmaj7
 Infinite and wide. Like the moon and sky collide.

[B]
.                 Em7
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
.        Cmaj7                         Em7
 Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now. (3X)

[T]
.Cmaj7
 Collide...
.Em7                     Cmaj7              Em7
 Here it comes, here it comes now, You and I (2X)
.        Em7                           Cmaj7
 Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now.||
.               Em7               Cmaj7
 Feel it comin' on, feel it comin' on.
.
 Here it comes now, here it comes,
.                                Em7 Cmaj7
 Here it comes, here it comes now.

1Take my life and  let it   be     conse____crated,    Lord, to   Thee;
2Take my hands and let them move   at the   impulse    of    Thy  love;
3Take my voice and let me   sing   always,  only,      for   my   King;
4Take my silver    and my   gold:  not a    mite would I     with_hold;
5Take my love: my  Lord, I  pour   at Thy   feet its   trea__sure store;
6Take my will and  make it  Thine: it shall be no      lon___ger  mine;

.D       A/C#      G        D
1Take my moments   and my   days,
2Take my feet and  let them be
3Take my lips and  let them be
4Take my intel_____lect and use
5Take my_self and  I will   be
6Take my heart: it is Thine own,

.D/F#        G     D/F# A/E        A
1Let them    flow  in   ceaseless  praise,
2Swift and   beau__ti___ful  for   Thee,
3Filled with mes___sa___ges from   Thee,
4Every       pow'r as   Thou shalt choose,
5Ever,       on____ly,  all  for   Thee,
6It shall    be    Thy  royal      throne,

.Bm          G        D/A  A     D
1Let them    flow in  ceaseless  praise.
2Swift and   beauti___ful  for   Thee.
3Filled with messa____ges  from  Thee.
4Every       pow'r as Thou shalt choose.
5Ever,       only,    all  for   Thee.
6It shall    be Thy   ro___yal   throne.</lyrics></song>

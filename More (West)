  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                  Am       C
 Take a look at the mountain,| stretching a mile high.
.F                  Am    C                     Bbmaj7
 Take a look at the ocean,| far as your eye can see,
.    F/A
 And think of Me.

[V2]
.F                  Am     C
 Take a look at the desert.| Do you feel like a grain of sand?
.F                 Am   C                         Bb
 I am with you wherever;| where you go is where I am.

[P]
.               Ab          Bb          Ab          Bb
 And I'm always thinking of you.|Take a look around you;
.    Ab          Bb         F
 I'm spelling it out one by one.

[C]
.  N.C.     C5             
 I love you more than the sun
.        F2(no3)                    Am
 And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                      F
 You are Mine, and you shine for Me too.||
.          C5                 F2(no3)
 I love you   yesterday and today and tomorrow;
.     Am                G 
 I'll say it again and again:
.       F2(no3) Am    C (F2(no3) Am C to verses)
 I love you     more.

[V3]
 Just a face in the city,|just a tear on a crowded street.
 But you are one in a million,|and you belong to Me.

[P2]
.      Ab          Bb            Ab          Bb
 And I want you to know|that I'm not letting go,
.Ab        Bb         F
 Even when you come undone.

[B]
.Dm        C/E  F2(no3)               C
 Shine for Me.          You shine for Me.
.Dm            C/E         Ab              Bb
 You shine on. You shine on. You shine for Me.

[C2]
.           D5          
 I love you more than the sun
.        G2(no3)                    Bm
 And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                      G
 You are mine, and you shine for me too.||
.          D5               G2(no3)
 I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow; 
.     Bm                 A
 I'll say it again and again:||
.           D5             
 I love you more than the sun
.        G2(no3)                    Bm
 And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                      G
 You are mine, and you shine for me too.||
.          D5               G2(no3)                       Bm
 I love you yesterday and today,  through the joy and the pain, 
.                       A
 I'll say it again and again:

[T]
.       G2(no3) Bm    D
 I love you     more.
.       G2(no3) Bm    D
 I love you     more.||
.G2(no3) Bm  D
   And I see you, and I made you,
.G2(no3) Bm   D.                     G      Bm
   And I love you more than you can imagine,||
.D                 G      
 More than you can fathom.
.Bm   D                  G   Bm 
    I love you more than the sun,
.D                G    Bm  D
 and you shine for  Me.
.G Bm D G Bm D

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                          D
 What can wash away my sin? What can make me whole again? 
.D                         D
 For my pardon this I see. For my cleasing this my plea.

[C]
.C   G            D
 Oh precious is the flow,
.C     G               D
 That makes me white as snow;
.C    G      D
 No other fount I know,
.C             G            D
 Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

[V2]
.D
 Nothing can for sin atone, (nothing but the blood of Jesus)
. D
 Naught of good that I have done (nothing but the blood of Jesus)
. D
 This is all my hope and peace (nothing but the blood of Jesus)
.D
 This is all my righteousness (nothing but the blood of Jesus)

[T]
.C             G            D
 Nothing, nothing, nothing but the blood of Jesus.

[V3]
.D                          D C G D C G
 Now by this I'll overcome
.D                               D C G D C G
 Now by this I'll reach my home
.D
 Glory, glory, this I see (nothing but the blood of Jesus)
.D
 All my praise for this I bring (nothing but the blood of Jesus) (last line 3x)

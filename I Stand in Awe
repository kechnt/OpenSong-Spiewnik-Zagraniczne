  <lyrics>[V1]
.        A                   E             D2/A          A
 You are beautiful beyond description, Too marvelous for words,
.    A                   F#m           D                    E
 Too wonderful for comprehension, Like nothing ever seen or heard.||
.        F#m                 A               D                         E
 Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom? Who can fathom the depths of Your love?
.        A                   E              D    E        A
 You are beautiful beyond description, Majesty enthroned above.


[C]
.E     A        E/A       D
 And I stand, I stand, in awe of You;
.  A        E/A      D
 I stand, I stand in awe of You;
.     C#sus            Dmaj7
 Holy God, to whom all praise is due,
.  Bm7      E      D/A A
 I stand in awe of You.


[V2]
.        A                   E                D2/A               A
 You are beautiful beyond description Yet God crushed You for my sin
.   A                F#m          D                      E
 In agony and deep affliction Cut off that I might enter in.||
.        F#m                  A                D2/A                 E
 Who can grasp such tender compassion? Who can fathom this mercy so free?
.        A                   E                 D       E        A
 You are beautiful beyond description, Lamb of God who died for me.</lyrics>

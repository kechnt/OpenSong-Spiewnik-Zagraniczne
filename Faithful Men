.G                 C        D               C  G
 Come and join the reapers, All the kingdom seekers;
.G                C       G              D
 Laying down your life to find it in the in.

[2]
.G                  C        D                 C   G
 Come and share the harvest, Help to light the darkness,
.G               C       G    D   G
 For the Lord is calling faithful men.</lyrics></song>

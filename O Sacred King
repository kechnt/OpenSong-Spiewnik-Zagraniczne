.G         C
 O Sacred king
.G       C
 O Holy King
.Am         C            D
 How can I honor You rightly
.Am           C             D
 Honor that's fit for Your name

[V2]
.G         C
 O Sacred Friend
.G        C
 O Holy friend
.Am            C           D
 I don't take what You did lightly
.Am              C          D
 Friendship instead of disgrace

[C]
.             G
 For it's the mystery of the universe
.Am
 You're the God of holiness
.G/B                        C
 Yet You welcome souls like me||
.             G
 And with the blessing of your father's heart
.    Am
 You discipline the ones you love
.        G/B                   C
 There's kindness in Your majesty||
.      Am                        D
 Jesus those who recognize your power
.     Am                     D
 Know just how wonderful You are
.              G
 When You draw near.</lyrics>

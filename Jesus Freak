.Em  C	       A                        Em              C          A
1Separated, I cut myself clean |from a past that comes back|in my darkest of dreams.||
2Kamikaze, my death is gain.|I've been marked by my    Maker, a peculiar display.||
.Em           C           A                         Em             C              A
1Been appre___hended by a spiritual force|and a     grace that   replaced all the me I divorced.
2The high and lofty, they see me as weak,|'cause I  won't live and die, for the   power they seek.

.            Em                       C                     A
1I saw a     man with a tat    on his big fat belly.|It     wiggled around like marmalade jelly.||
2There was a man from the desert with naps in his head.|The sand that he walked was also his bed.||
.    Em                           C                            A
1It  took me a while to           catch what it said,|'cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.||
2The words that he spoke made the people assume,|there         wasn't too much left in the upper room.||
.     Em                    C                      A
1     "Jesus Saves" is      what it raved, in a    typical tatoo green.||
2With skins on his back and hair on his face,|they thought he was strange by the locust he ate.||
.           Em                          C                          A
1He         stood on a box in the       middle of the city|and he  claimed he had a dream.
2Ya see the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak,|until the king took the head of this Jesus Freak.

.Em               G               D               A     Bm
 What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
.Em               G            D             A  Bm
 What will people do when they find out it's true?||
.Em             G            D          A     Bm
 I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak.
.Em                G           D    A Bm
 There ain't no disguising the truth.

.Em             G/F           A/F                      Em      G/F        A/F       Em
 People say I'm strange, does that make me a stranger?|My best friend was born in a manger.|(2x)

.Em               G       D         A  Bm          Em               G    D         A  Bm
 What will people think?|(What will people think?)|What will people do?|(What will people do?)||
.Em             G      D         A   Bm      Em                G           D             A  Bm  Em
 I don't really care.|(What else can I say?)|There ain't no disguising the truth.|(Jesus is the way.)</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.            G                   Cadd9
 Twenty four oceans… Twenty four skies…
.            D/F#                  G
 Twenty four failures… Twenty four tries…
.            Em                         Cadd9
 Twenty four finds me… In twenty-fourth place
.            D/F#                         G
 Twenty four drop outs… At the end of the day.

[V2]
.                   Em                          Cadd9
 Life is not what I thought it was…|Twenty four hours ago. 
.                  D/F#                           G
 Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.
.                  Em                        Cadd9 
 And I'm not who I thought I was twenty four hours ago.
.                  D/F#                           G 
 Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.

[V3]
.            G                         Cadd9
 Twenty four reasons to admit that I'm wrong
.            D/F#                      G 
 With all my excuses still twenty four strong.
.    Em              Cadd9            D/F#             Cadd9  
 See I'm not copping out, not copping out, not copping out
.                        D/F# 
 When You're raising the dead in me.

[C1]

 And You're raising these twenty four voices…| With twenty four hearts
.               D/F#                       G
 With all of my symphonies…|In twenty four parts.
.                   Em                  Cadd9
 But I wanna be one today…|Centered and true.
.            D/F#                           G
 I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.

 And You're raising the dead in me

[V5]
.              G                       Cadd9
 I want to see miracles, see the world change.
.             D/F#                   G
 Wrestled the angel, for more than a name,
.                Em                       Cadd9
 For more than a feeling, for more than a cause.
.            D/F#                           G
 I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You

 And You're raising the dead in me.

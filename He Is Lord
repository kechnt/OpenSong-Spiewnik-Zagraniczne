.E              B      A            E      A                B            E
 Emptied of His glory, God became a man|To walk on earth in ridicule and shame;
.  A           B          C#m            F#      E               B          E
 A Ruler yet a Servant, a Shepherd yet a Lamb,|A Man of sorrows, agony, and pain.

[V2]
.E             B       A            E        A                 B              E
 Humbled and rejected, beaten and despised,|Upon the cross the Son of God was slain;
.     A              B            C#m          F#        E                B               E
 Just like a lamb to slaughter: a sinless Sacrifice,|But by His death His loss became our gain.

[C]
.E     F#m   B     E            E     E/D#     C#m            F#m  B
 He is Lord, He is Lord!|He has risen from the dead and He is Lord!
.      E          E7         A         Am        E     B         E
 Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess|that Jesus Christ is Lord!

[V3]
.E              B        A             E         A                   B              E
 Satan's forces crumbled like a mighty wall,|The stone that held Him in was rolled aside;
.    A                 B         C#m         F#       E                B             E
 The Prince of Life in glory was lifted over all,|Now earth and heaven echo with the cry!

[CFinal]
.E       F#m   B       E              E     E/D#     C#m              F#m  B
 You are Lord, You are Lord!|You have risen from the dead and You are Lord!
.       E          E7          A         Am        E     B         E
 And my knee shall bow, and my tongue confess|that Jesus Christ is Lord!</lyrics></song>

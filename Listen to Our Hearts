  <lyrics>[V1]
.C#m          A                   C#m
 How do you explain,|How do you describe,
.                      A
 A love that goes from East to West
.B                         C#m
 And runs as deep as it is wide?

[P]
.                 A                             C#m
 You know all our hopes. Lord, You know all our fears.
.                  A                  B
 And words cannot express the love we feel,
.                       C#m
 But we long for You to hear.

[C]
.                 A                        C#m
 So listen to our hearts,|hear our spirits sing
.                      A          B              E
 A song of praise that flows|from those You have redeemed.||
.                A
 We will use the words we know
.   B                  E     B       C#m
 To tell You what an awesome God You are.
.                   A                        B
 But words are not enough|To tell You of our love,
.                 E
 So listen to our hearts

[V2]
.C#m                      A                       C#m
 If words could fall like rain|From these lips of mine,
.               A              B
 And if I had a thousand years,
.                         C#m
 I would still run out of time.||
.                    A                      C#m
 If You listen to my heart,|every beat will say,
.                   A                       B
 "Thank You for the life,|thank You for the truth,
.                  C#m
 Thank You for the way."

[T]
.E              A                        B
 Words are not enough to tell You of our love,
.   B7            E
 So listen to our hearts.</lyrics>

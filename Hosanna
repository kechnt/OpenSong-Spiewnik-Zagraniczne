  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                        C#m
 I see the King of Glory coming on the clouds with fire;||
.                 F#m7                     B     (C#m to V2)
 The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes.

[V2]
 I see His love and mercy washing over all our sin;||
 The people sing, the people sing:

[C]
.    E/G# A   B C#m
 Hosanna!   Hosanna!
.    A            C#m    B
 Hosanna in the highest!
.    E/G# A   B C#m
 Hosanna!   Hosanna!
.    A            C#m    B  (E to Chorus)
 Hosanna in the highest!

[V3]
 I see a generation, rising up to take their place||
 With selfless faith, with selfless faith.

[V4]
 I see a near revival, stirring as we pray and seek.||
 We're on our knees, we're on our knees.

[Instrumental]
.C#m E F#m7 G#m7  (2X)

[B]
. A                         B
 Heal my heart and make it clean.
. E                      C#m
 Open up my eyes to the things unseen.||
. A                        B             C#m
 Show me how to love like You have loved me.
. A                               B
 Break my heart for what breaks Yours.||
.     E                     C#m
 Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
.A                      B        A
 As I walk from earth into eternity.</lyrics>

;CAPO 1

[V1]
.G      Am              F
 All my world, all I've lost,
.                C                       Gsus
 The wrecks I've made here, the lives it cost.||
.          G  Am                     F
 Your hand restores, Your words make whole.
.            C
 With all my soul, I thank You. I owe You all my...

[C]
.  G
 Devotion.
.           C
 All that I have to give.
.            G
 Here's my devotion
.                   C
 You're all that it means to live.

[V2]
.G      Am               F
 All my past, my tainted name,
.              C                   Gsus
 You stole its legacy of pride and shame.||
.       G     Am                 F
 You're all I love, You're all I fear.
.            C
 I'm drawing near to face You, to know You, to show You

[B]
.    F
 You found me in a shallow grave.
.    Am
 You dragged me out from beneath it all.
.    F
 You healed me, saved me
.       C
 In the nick of time, Your perfect time.||
---
.    F
 You found me in a shallow grave.
.    Am
 You called me out from beneath it all.
.    F
 You touched me, saved me
.       C
 In the nick of time, in Your perfect time.||
.    G
 I devote all I have to You.
.    G
 I devote all that You've made new,
.           C
 All You restored that day You bled,
.             C
 All that You brought back from the dead. Oh!

[T]
.              G
 My Lord, my devotion.

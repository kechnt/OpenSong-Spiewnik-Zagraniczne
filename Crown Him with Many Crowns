  <lyrics>[V1]
.D              Bm   G           D/F#  G       Asus   A
 Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne;
.A    D       Bm       E      A       D   A     E       A   A7
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns, all music but its own;||
. D                G        E                A    A7
 Awake my soul and sing, of Him who died for Thee,
.    D/F#     G      Em7       D            Em7  A    D
 And hail Him as Thy matchless King through all eternity.


[V2]
.D             Bm      G         D/F#      G        Asus  A
 Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed o'er the grave;
.A   D       Bm      E      A       D   A        E       A    A7
 And rose victorious in the strife, for those He came to save;||
.    D              G         E                A    A7
 His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high,
.    D/F#  G      Em7     D         Em7        A         D
 Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die.


[V3]
.D             Bm      G       D/F#     G         Asus A
 Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side;
.A    D          Bm  E    A     D  A      E    A    A7
 Rich wounds yet visible above, in beauty glorified;||
.    D             G         E                  A  A7
 All hail Redeemer hail, for Thou hast died for me,
.    D/F#         G      Em7   D            Em7  A    D
 Thy praise shall never, never fail, throughout eternity.</lyrics>

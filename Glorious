[V1]
 We lift our hands in praise to You.
 We lift our hearts in worship to You, Lord.||
 We lift our voice to You and sing.
 Our greatest love will ever be You, Lord,
 You, Lord!

[C]
 Glorious, over us,
 You shall reign glorious.

[V2]
 There is a King that we adore.
 With humble hearts we bow before You, Lord.||
 There is a place we long to be.
 Yes, face to face, we long to see You, Lord,
 You, Lord!

[B]
 Majesty and power
 Are Yours alone forever! (2X)</lyrics>

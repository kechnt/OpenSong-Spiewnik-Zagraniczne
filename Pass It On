  <lyrics>[V1]
.   C            Em       F          G
 It only takes a spark to get a fire going,
.    C               Em         F              G
 And soon all those around, can warm up in its glowing;
.       F              C           Dm   G        Em        Am
 That's how it is with God's love, Once you've experienced it;
.    Dm7        C       Dm7  C        F       G       C
 You spread His love to everyone, you want to pass it on.

[V2]
.       C                Em           F                 G
 What a wondrous time is spring, when all the trees are budding,
.    C              Em        F                   G
 The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming;
.       F              C           Dm   G        Em        Am
 That's how it is with God's love, Once you've experienced it;
.    Dm7     C           Dm7        C            F       G       C
 You want to sing, "It's fresh like spring", you want to pass it on.

[V3]
.  C               Em           F              G
 I wish for you my friend, this happiness that I've found,
.    C             Em      F                 G
 You can depend on Him, it matters not where you're bound;
.     F                 C                          Dm         G
 I'll shout it from the mountain top - PRAISE GOD! I want the world to know;
.    Dm7     C        Dm7     C     F       G       C
 The Lord of love has come to me, I want to pass it on.</lyrics></song>

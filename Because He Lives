  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                 C                 G                  Am   D7
 God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to love, heal, and forgive;
.             G              C                G                 D7              G
 He lived and died to buy my pardon;|An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

[C]
.           G                   C
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
.           G                  D7
 Because He lives, all fear is gone;
.          G D7 G7              C
 Because I know___ He holds the future,
.            G                D7              G
 And life is worth the living just because He lives.

[V2]
.G                           C                 G                Am    D7
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride and joy he gives;
.            G                C                      G              D7              G
 But greater still the calm assurance|This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

[V3]
.G                                C                        G              Am   D7
 And then one day I'll cross that river; I'll fight life's final war with pain;
.            G                  C                     G               D7               G
 And then as death gives way to vict'ry,|I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.</lyrics>

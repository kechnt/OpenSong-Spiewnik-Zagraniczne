.        E
 Well, I hear they're singing in the streets 
.     A
 That Jesus is alive,
.    E
 And all creation shouts aloud 
.      A
 That Jesus is alive.||
.      E
 Now surely we can all be changed 
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
.         E
 And everybody here can know
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.


[P]
.   C#m7                         A
 And I will live for all my days 
.              E                    B
 To raise a banner of truth and light,
.   C#m7                          A
 To sing about my Saviour's love
.         E
 And the best thing that happened:
.           B
 It was the day I met You.


[C]
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus,
.            E       A
 I've found Jesus.

[V2]
.        E
 Well, I feel like dancing in the streets
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
.   E
 To join with all who celebrate
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.||
.    E
 The joy of God is in this town 
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive;
.         E
 For everybody's seen the truth,
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.


[B]
.          C#m7
 Well, you lifted me from where I was,
.A                        
 Set my feet upon a rock.
.F#m7                             A
 Humbled that you even know about me.
.   C#m7                         A
 Now I have chosen to believe,
.     A
 Believing that you've chosen me;
.F#m7                           A
 I was lost but now I've found...</lyrics>

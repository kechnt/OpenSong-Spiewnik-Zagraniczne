  <lyrics>[V1]
.    Gsus/F  C           Csus  C
 I'm finding myself at a loss   for words,
.C2(no3)    C/F           Gsus/F C/F 
 And the funny  thing is, it's  okay.
.               Gsus/F Gsus C    Csus C
 The last thing I      need   is to   be heard,
.C2(no3)   C/F      F2(no3)         C/F      
 But to hear   what You     would say.


[C]
.                 C
 Word of God, speak.
.                            Gsus
 Would You pour down like rain,
.G       F/A    Bb2(no3)               F
 Washing my  eyes        to see Your majesty,||
.                   C
 To be still and know
.                        Gsus
 That You're in this place?
.G          F/A   Bb2(no3)
 Please let me stay       and rest
.        F
 In Your holiness.||
.                  C Csus C C2(no3) C/F F2(no3) C/F
 Word of God, speak.


[V2]
.    Gsus/F  C             Csus  C
 I'm finding myself in the midst  of You,
.C2(no3)    C/F      Gsus/F   C/F 
 Beyond the music, beyond the    noise.
.         Gsus/F Gsus  C      Csus C
 All that I      need   is to be   with You,
.    C2(no3)   C/F F2(no3)       C/F  
 And in the quiet, hear Your voice.


[T]
.              C         Csus  C
 I'm finding myself at a loss   for words,
.C2(no3)    C/F          F2(no3) C/F 
 And the funny thing is, it's   okay.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V]
.       G               D/F#
 When I think about the Lord,
.       Em               E7
 How He saved me, how He raised me,
.       Am7                Em
 How He filled me with the Holy Ghost,
.       C                D
 How He healed me to the uttermost,||
.       G               D/F#
 When I think about the Lord,
.       Em               E7
 How He picked me up and turned me around,
.       Am7         F
 How He set my feet
.         D
 On solid ground:


[C]
.                  G
 It makes me wanna shout,
.      D/F#              Em
 "Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
.             E7                Am7
 Lord, You're worthy of all the glory
.            Em                C    D
 And all the honor and all the praise!"</lyrics>

  <lyrics>;CAPO 4 - Tune to Eb

[V1]
.G/B       C           G/B               C
 From wherever spring arrives to heal the ground,
.G/B       C             G/B               C
 From wherever searching comes, the look itself,||
.G/B         C                 G/B
 A trace of what we're looking for,
.            C       G/B  C
 So be quiet now and wait.

[P]
.D         C  D         C
 The ocean    is growing.
.D           C
 The tide is coming in. Here it is.

[C]
.            G                 G/B
 Here is our King. Here is our Love.
.            C
 Here is our God who's come
.                    G
 To bring us back to Him.
.          G/B         C
 He is the One. He is Jesus.

[V2]
.G/B      C                G/B              C
 And what was said to the rose to make it unfold
.G/B         C              G/B
 Was said to me here in my chest,
.       C            G/B   C
 So be quiet now and rest.

[B]
.Em D/F# G   Am G/B C
 Ma_jes__ty  fi_nal_ly.
.Em D/F# G   Am G/B  C D
 Ma_jes__ty  fi_nal_ly here.

[T]
.Em D/F# G   C  Em D/F#  C     G
 Ma_jes__ty     fi_nal_ly  here.</lyrics></song>

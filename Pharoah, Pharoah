  <lyrics>[V1]
.          A            D                Em    D
 Well, the burning bush told me just the other day
.     A        D         Em       D
 That I should come over here and say
.A             D             Em        D
 Got to get my people out of Pharaoh's hand
.    A            D           Em       D
 And lead them on over to the promised land.

[C]
.      A           D     Em D
 I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Oh baby
.       A          D  
 Let my people go! Huh
.Em        D
 Yeah yeah yeah... (2X)

[V2] 
.                   A           D      Em  D
 Well, all of God's people came to the Red Sea
.     A         D           Em    D
 With Pharaoh's army coming after me
.  A         D             Em     D
 I raised my rod, stuck it in the sand
.    A            D               Em   D
 And all of God's people walked across dry land.

[V3] 
.     A                D        Em     D
 Well all of Pharaoh's army was coming too
.   A           D          Em    D
 So what do you think that I did do?
.  A         D       Em         D
 I raised my rod and cleared my throat 
.    A                D            Em         D
 And all of Pharaoh's army did the dead man's float.</lyrics></song>

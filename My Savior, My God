  <lyrics>[V1]
.D
 I am not skilled to understand
.                                    Bm7
 What God has willed, what God has planned.
.                         A
 I only know at His right hand
.                       D2
 Stands one who is my Savior.


[V2]
 I take Him at His word and deed.
 Christ died to save me this I read.
 And in my heart I find a need
 Of Him to be my Savior.


[P]
.                                  G2
 That He would leave His place on high
.                           D2
 And come for sinful man to die,
.                                 Asus
 You count it strange, so once did I,
.                   D2
 Before I knew my Savior.


[C]
.          Bm7              G2
 My Savior loves. My Savior lives.
.              D2             A
 My Savior's always there for me.
.          Bm7            G2
 My God He was. My God He is.
.          D             A
 My God is always gonna be. (2X)


[V3]
 Yes, living, dying let me bring
 My strength, my solace|from this spring:
 That He who lives to be my King
 Once died to be my Savior.</lyrics>

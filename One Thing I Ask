[V1]
.G           D    Em7         Bm7
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek,
.C          G             C         D
 That I may dwell in Your house, oh Lord.
.G         D     Em7       Bm7
 All of my days, all of my life,
.C          Dsus D    G
 That I may see  You, Lord.

[C]
.D   Em7     C        Em7   Am G/B C
 One thing I ask, one thing I  de__sire,
.      G   C          G   C
 Is to see You, is to see You.

[V2]
 Hear me, oh Lord, hear me when I cry.
 Lord, do not hide Your face from me.
 You have been my strength,
 You have been my shield,
 And You will lift me up.

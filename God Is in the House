.G/B    Cmaj7            B7
 As for me, God came and found me
.       Em7            F/G  
 As for me, He took me home
.       Cmaj7            A9 
 As for me, He gave me a family
.      Am    G/B  C  D     
 And I never walk a**lone,
.G7    Cmaj7                A9     B/D#
 In my life,  I'm soaked in bless**ing
.       Em7                    A9 
 And in heaven there's a great reward
.       G         Em7
 As for me and my house

 We're gonna serve the Lord

.         G                Gmaj7            G 
 I've got Jesus, Jesus, He calls me for His own
.       C                  Cmaj7             C 
 And He lifts me, lifts me above the world I know
.    G/D                    Em     
 God is in the house, there is no doubt
.G/D                        C2  
 God is in the house, Can't keep Him out
.       G/D                      Em
 As for you (As for you), As for me (As for me)
.A9          C/D       G 
 We're gonna serve the Lord</lyrics>

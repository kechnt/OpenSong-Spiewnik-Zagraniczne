  <lyrics>[V1]
 He is jealous for me,
 Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
 When all of a sudden,
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
 And I realise just how beautiful You are,
 And how great Your affections are for me.
 
[B]
 And oh, how He loves us so,
 Oh how He loves us,
 How He loves us all
 
[C1]
 Yeah, He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves.
 Yeah, He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves.
 
[V2]
 We are His portion and He is our prize,
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
 If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking.
 So Heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
 I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
 When I think about, the way…
 
[C2]
 He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Oh how He loves.
 Yeah, He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves.
 
[V3]
 Well, I thought about You the day Stephen died,
 And You met me between my breaking.
 I know that I still love You, God, despite the agony.
...They want to tell me You're cruel,
 But if Stephen could sing, he'd say it's not true, cause...
 
[C3]
 Cause He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us.
 Whoa! how He loves us.
 Whoa! how He loves.
 Yeah, He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves us,
 Whoa! how He loves.</lyrics></song>

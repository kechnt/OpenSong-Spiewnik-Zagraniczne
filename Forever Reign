  <lyrics>[V1]
 You are good
 You are good when there's nothing good in me||
 You are love You are love on display for all to see||
 You are light
 You are light when the darkness closes in||
 You are hope
 You are hope You have covered all my sin

[V2]
 You are peace
 You are peace when my fear is crippling||
 You are true
 You are true even in my wandering||
 You are joy
 You are joy You're the reason that I sing||
 You are life
 You are life in You death has lost its sting

[C]
 (Oh) I'm running to Your arms
 I'm running to Your arms||
 The riches of Your love
 Will always be enough||
 Nothing compares to Your embrace
 Light of the world forever reign

[V3]
 You are more
 You are more than my words will ever say||
 You are Lord
 You are Lord all creation will proclaim||
 You are here
 You are here in Your presence I'm made whole||
 You are God
 You are God of all else I'm letting go

[B]
 My heart will sing no other Name
 Jesus, Jesus</lyrics></song>

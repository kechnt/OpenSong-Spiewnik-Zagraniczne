  <lyrics>.G Dsus4/F# G/F C2 D

[V1]
.G         Dsus4/F#        G/F            C2     D       G
 Steadfast Stephen saw his chance to open wide unveiling lies;
.G     Dsus4/F#          G/F            C2          D      C2
 Delivering his skin and bones upon the hate-filled battle cries;
.C2   G          C2       G           C2                  G          D    C2
 They rushed him and they stoned him, but his sights were set on the open skies.

[C]
.C2         D       G       D/F#   C2                    D
 I'm in the wake of martyrs gone before me waiting to be tried;
.C2     D            G       D/F#    C2                                D
 Is the strength and trust I have in You enough that I would stand and die?
.          G
 Stand and die.

[V2]
.G         Dsus4/F#     G/F            C2       D       G
 Caught in Cassie was a candle burning from the wick of life;
.G       Dsus4/F#          G/F               C2        D        C2
 She had found it when she finally turned to You, that graceful night;
.C2        G         C2     G         C2              G     D
 When they asked her if she knew You, what else could she reply?

[B]
.G        Dsus4/F#      G/F                 C2       D    G
 Now it's nearly twenty hundred years since You were crucified;
.G       Dsus4/F#           G/F             C2         D       C2
 With my heart and soul and all You gave to me I would give my life.</lyrics>

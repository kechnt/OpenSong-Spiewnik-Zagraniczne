.C#m               E                         A            E
1I'm here with the others who saw the        heavens testify.
2He raises a       wrinkled hand through the dust and the flies.
.C#m                  E                 A            B                 C#m
1Now I hang back      in the shadows; I want to come close, I want to  know.||
2Wrapped in rags like we are|and with   barely open  eyes, He takes my finger||
.            E                    A                 E
1She sees me shivering here,  she smiles and with a nod,
2And He      won't let go, and he won't let         go.
.C#m                 E                     A              E
1I walk through the  mud and straw|to the  newborn Son of God.
2It's nothing like I knew before, and it's all I need to  know.

 Come let us adore Him; He has|come down to this barren land
.         B
 Where we live,
.          A               B   A    E
 And all I have to give Him|is Adoration.

 God is with us here,

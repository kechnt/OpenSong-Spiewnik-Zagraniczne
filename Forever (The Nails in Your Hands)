[V]
.    G                        Em7
 The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet,
.     C2                   Dsus     D
 They tell me how much You love me.
.    G                         Em7
 The thorns on Your brow, they tell me how
.    C2                    Dsus    D
 You bore so much shame to love me.

[P]
              Bm7           C2
 And when the heavens pass away,
.             Bm7                C2
 And all Your scars they still remain,
.       Bm7            C2
 And forever they will say
.Am7          Dsus    D  Dsus D Dsus D
 How much You love me.

[C]
.   G                Em7
 Forever my love, forever my heart,
.   C2              Dsus   D
 Forever my life is Yours.
.   G                Em7
 Forever my love, forever my heart,
.   C2              Dsus   D
 Forever my life is Yours.

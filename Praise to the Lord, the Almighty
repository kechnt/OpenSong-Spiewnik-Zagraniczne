.G                            D             C          D    G
1Praise to the Lord,   the  Almighty, the   King of crea____tion.
2Praise to the Lord who o'er  all things so wondrously reig_neth.
3Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy   work and defend thee.
4Praise to the Lord,  o  let  all that is   in   me   adore Him.

.G                              D              C             D    G
1O my soul praise Him, for      He is thy      health and salv___ation.
2Shelters thee under His        wings, yea, so gently      sustai_neth
3Surely His goodness and        mercy here     daily       attend thee.
4All that hath life and breath, come now with  praises     before Him.

.G             C     Em             C               D
1All  ye  who  hear, now to His     temple   draw   near.
2Hast thou not seen  how thy      desires e're have been
3Ponder       anew   what the     Almighty   can    do
4Let   the    amen   sound from His people         again,

.Em          C         D      G      G C G D
1Join me in  glad  adora______tion.
2Granted in  what He ordai____neth?
3If with His love He befriend thee.
4Gladly for  aye we   adore   Him.

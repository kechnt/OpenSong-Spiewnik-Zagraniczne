  <lyrics>[V1]
 Higher than the mountains I face
 Stronger than the power of the grave||
 Constant in the trial and the change
 One thing remains
 One thing remains

[I]
 Your love
 Your love
 Your love will never change

[C]
 / Your love never fails in never gives up never runs out on me /x3
 Your love

[V2]
 On and on and on and on it goes
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul||
 And I never ever have to be afraid
 One thing remains
 One thing remains

[B]
 In death in life I'm confident and covered by
 The power of Your great love||
 My debt is paid there's nothing that can separate
 My heart from Your great love</lyrics></song>

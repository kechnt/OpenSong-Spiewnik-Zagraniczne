[V1]
.D                    Bm      A
 All creatures of our God and King,
.D                      Bm      A    A/G
 Lift up your voice and with us sing,
.D/F# G D   Bm   E A
 Alle-luia! Alleluia!
.D            Bm              A
 Thou burning sun with golden beam,
.D           Bm               A
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam!

[C]
.G A      D    Em ( D/F# ) G ( A ) Bm
 O praise Him, O           praise Him,
.Bm  E  A  Bm  E  A  G   A  D
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

[V2]
 O rushing wind and breezes soft,
 O clouds that ride the winds aloft:
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 O rising morn, in praise rejoice,
 O lights of evening, find a voice.

[V3]
 O flowing waters, pure and clear,
 Make music for your Lord to hear.
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 O fire so masterful and bright,
 Providing us with warmth and light,

[V4]
 Let all things their Creator bless,
 And worship Him in humbleness,
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,
 And praise the Spirit, three in One!</lyrics>

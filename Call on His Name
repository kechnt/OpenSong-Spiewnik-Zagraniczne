Our lives are never the same... [C] For the Lord! Lift our voice in one accord!  You are the one who answers, then and again and after.|| Show us Lord! By faith and through the Word, You are the one who leads us; in pain and joy you meet us. [B] We receive grace upon grace!  We believe you, Lord! (Now shout it out!)</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>;INTRO.   G   D/F#  Em7   D   Em   A   D

[V1]
.A   D       A         G D/F# Em7 D
 The first nowell, the angel  did say,
.       G  D/F# Em7  D            Em        A    D
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,
.A  D                 A      G D/F#  Em7   D
 In fields where they lay, a keeping their sheep,
.     G    D/F# Em7 D          Em  A  D
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

[C]
.A D       A       G       D/F#
 Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
.G   D/F# Em7 D       Em A D
 Born is  the King of Israel.

[V2]
 They looked up and saw a star,
 As it shone in the east beyond them far.
 And to the earth, it gave great light,
 And so it continued both day and night.

[V3]
 And by the light of that same star,
 Three wise men came from country far,
 To seek for a King was their intent,
 And to follow the star wherever it went.

[V4]
 The star drew nigh to the north-west,
 O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest,
 And there it did both stop and stay,
 Right over the place where Jesus lay.

[V5]
 Then entered in those wise men three,
 Full reverently upon their knee,
 And offered there in His presence,
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

[V6]
 Then let us all with one accord
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
 Who hath made heaven and earth of nought,
 And with His blood mankind hath bought.</lyrics></song>

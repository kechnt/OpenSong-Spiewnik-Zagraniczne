[Intro]
.C C#4 C C#4 G

[V1]
.C   C#4  C  C#4          G
 Are we left here on our own?
.C   C#4   C       C#4                  G
 Can you feel when your last breath is gone?

[P1]
.Em                  C    D
 Night is weighing heavy now.
.C             D           C              D
 Be quiet and wait for a voice that will say:

[C]
.       G          D/F#   C
 Come awake, from sleep arise.
.           G     D/F#   C
 You were dead; become alive.
.                G  D/F#       C
 Wake up, wake up; open your eyes.
.                  G    D/F#      C
 Climb from your grave into the light.||
.                  Em
 Bring us back to life.

[V2]
.C   C#4 C   C#4       G
 You are not the only one
.C   C#4    C   C#4       G
 Who feels like the only one.

[P2]
.Em                  C      D
 Night will soon be lifted, friend.
.     C          D           C              D
 Just be quiet, wait|for a voice that will say:

[B1]
.C   C#4 C C#4 .
 Arise...     |Shine...|

[B2]
.G   D/F#      C              G
 Wake up, wake up; light will shine.

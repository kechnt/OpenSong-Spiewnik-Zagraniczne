[V1]
.                G        Am7             G/B       C
 I'm learning to love You,    to love and trust You.
.                G/B      C           D  C
 I'm learning to give You  all that I am.
.                G        Am7                    G/B     C
 I'm learning to cling to     the words You have spoken.
.                G/B    C                 D     C
 I'm learning to let go,  my life in Your hands.

 For You are faithful, In all of Your ways,

 So teach me to love You, to love and to trust You,
 And teach me to give You, all that I am.
 And teach me to cling to the words You have spoken;
 Teach me to let go, my life in Your hands. 

[B]
.F2                                       C
 We are like shadows that change with the day;
.F2                                    C
 And like the flowers, our beauty will fade.
.Cm/Eb                             F
 But Your's is the kingdom and the power, 
.Cm/Eb                  F                   G   Am7   G/B   C    G   Am7  G/B  C
 Forever and ever, Your glory will always remain.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.B/D#                     B/D#
 You're arriving with the sound|of thunder and rain.
.B/D#                   B/D#
 You're arriving in the calm|of the wind and the waves.
.B/D#                             E
 You're arriving in the glow|of a burning flame,
.  B/D#
 A burning flame.

[V2]
 Praise awaits You at the dawn|when the world comes alive.
 Praise awaits You in the darkness|and shines in the light.
 Praise awaits You with a song|of love and desire,
 Love and desire.

[C1]
.     A2                  E
 Here comes the King; all bow down.
.             B/D#
 Lift up your voices unto the Lamb.
.      A2            E
 He is the King; all bow down.
.    B/D#
 All bow down.

[V3]
 You are coming again|like a thief in the night.
 You are coming again|with a shout from the sky.
 You are coming again|to take away Your bride,
 To take away Your bride.

[B]
.B/D# A2      E
 Ye___ah, You are the King.
.B/D# A2      E
 Ye___ah, You are the King.

[C2]
 You are the King; all bow down.
 Lift up your voices unto the Lamb.
 You are the King; all bow down.
 All bow down.</lyrics></song>

[V1]
.C#m                    F#m
 Hear the passion of my prayer, O Lord.
.A        B                 E
 I have a desperate need to praise Your name.
.C#m                       F#m                A
 Your forgiveness and Your mercy are the only way
.                  B
 That I can get to You to say:


[V2]
.C#m                    F#m
 Just to know You is to be alive.
.A             B            E 
 Your love has lifted me up from my grave.
.C#m                      F#m                A
 You have rescued me from sin and I am blown away.
.                    B
 It's all that I can do to say:</lyrics>

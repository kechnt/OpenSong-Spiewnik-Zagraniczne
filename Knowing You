  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Am        C              F    G   C
 All I once held dear, built my life upon,
.         Am        C       Am      G 
 All this world reveres and wars to own;
.      F    F/C     C           F     G    C 
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss,
.          Am        C        Am     G
 Spent and worthless now compared to this.

[C] 
.        F    C      F       C
 Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You
.      Am      G       F
 There is no greater thing.
.          C/E             F
 You're my all, You're the best,
.          C/E              F
 You're my joy, my righteousness,
.      C        F/G
 And I love you Lord.

[V2]
 Now my heart's desire is to know You more,
 To be found in You and known as Yours,
 To possess by faith what I could not earn,
 All surpassing gift of righteousness.

[V3]
 Oh, to know the power of Your risen life,
 And to know You in Your sufferings;
 To become like You in Your death, my Lord,
 So with You to live and never die.</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.           C                   Fmaj7
 God, in my living, there in my breathing,
.           Am                 G6
 God, in my waking, God, in my sleeping...||
.           C                    Fmaj7
 God, in my resting, there in my working,
.           Am                   G
 God, in my thinking, God, in my speaking...
 

[C]
.           Fmaj7
 Be my everything.
.G          Am
 Be my everything.
.G          Fmaj7
 Be my everything.
.G          C
 Be my everything.
 

[V2]
 God, in my hoping, there in my dreaming,
 God, in my watching, God, in my waiting...||
 God, in my laughing, there in my weeping,
 God, in my hurting. God, in my healing...
 

[B]

 The Hope of Glory,|You are everything.||
.F           G             Am
 Christ in me, Christ in me,  Christ in me,

 The Hope of Glory,|be my everything.


[C2]

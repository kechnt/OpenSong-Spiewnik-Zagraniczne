[V1]
 Ev'ryone around the world, hear the joyful sound,
 See the heavens open up, hear the music coming down.

[P]
 Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love.
 I can't help but celebrate 'Cause we're not alone.

[C]
 If God is on our side, who can be against us?
 If God is on our side, we won't be afraid.||
 Though the mountains may fall, and the sky will crumble,
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way.

[V2]
 Come one down to the riverside, wash it all away.
 Leave behind your troubled mind for an uncloudy day.</lyrics>

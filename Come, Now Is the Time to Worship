.D                        Dsus D
 Come, now is the time to wor__ship.
.A                        Em        G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart.
.D                        Dsus D
 Come, just as you are to wor__ship.
.A                     Em          G    D
 Come, just as you are before your God. Come.

.G                         D
 One day every tongue will confess You are God,
.G                       D
 One day every knee will bow;
.G                                   Bm
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
.    G                 A
 Who gladly choose You now.

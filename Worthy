.B               E2
 Worthy, you are worthy
.          B/D#          E2
 Much more worthy than I know
.B        C#m7
 I cannot imagine
.         B            E2
 Just how glorious you are

[B]
.F#sus        E2
 And I cannot begin to tell
.    B               E2
 How deep a love You bring
.F#sus               E2
 O Lord, my ears had heard of You
.    B                E2
 But now my eyes have seen

[C]
.        B
 You are worthy
.        C#m7
 You are worthy
.        B     E2
 You are worthy
.        B            C#m7
 You are worthy to be praised
.   B          E2
 Forever and a day

 Glory, I give glory
.          B/D#          E2
 To the One who saved my soul
.B               C#m7
 You found me and You freed me
.         B                 E2
 From the shame that was my own

[T]
.B             C#m7          B       E2
 Well sing an anthem of the highest praise

 Well sing an anthem of Your glorious name</lyrics>

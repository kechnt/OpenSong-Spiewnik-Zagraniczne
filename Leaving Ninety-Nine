.C Am Em G

[V1]
.C          Am           Em             G
 I'm lost and broken, all alone on this road.
.C             Am               Em           G
 The wheels keep turnin', but the feelin' is gone.
.         F      C     G
 When I fear I'm on my own,
.Am            F      C    G
 You remind me I am not alone when You said, 

[C]
.           C                       Am
 "I'd leave ninety-nine, leave them all behind,
.     Em      F          G
 to find you, for you alone.
.          C                       Am
 I'd leave ninety-nine, leave them all behind,
.     Em     F    G
 to find you."

[V2]
.C           Am             Em            G
 It's dark and lonely and the path is unclear.
.C             Am               Em          G
 Can't move my feet because I'm frozen in fear.
.         F             C         G
 Then you say, "My child, my child - 
.  Am        F           C       G
 I am always here, I'm by your side." 

[B]
.F                    G
 You're never too far down;
.                    Em
 I promise you'll be found.
.                     Am     G
 I'll reach into the mud and mire and clay,
.F                  G
 pursue you to the end
.                    Em
 like a faithful friend.
.                   G                C   Am   Em   G     C  Am  Em
 Nothing in this world can keep me away.</lyrics></song>

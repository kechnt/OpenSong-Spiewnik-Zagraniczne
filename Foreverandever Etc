[Intro]
.G C G C G C Em C

[V1]
.G       C           G      C                 G  C
 Love so incredible, to know it's never gonna go,
.            G  C
 Never gonna go.||
.G       C           G        C
 Love too impossible and true
.           G     C              G      C
 For anyone but you, for anyone but you.

[P1]
.D                   C                  D
 I think I'm on the brink of something large.
.               Em      D/F#   D
 Maybe like the breaking of a dawn,
.                C
 Or maybe like a match being lit,
.         E          D/F#
 Or the sinking of a ship,
.        G            Am7
 Letting go gives a better grip.

[C]
.G                  Am7               Em
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need.
.          C                      G
 By giving up, gaining everything.
.             D
 Falling for You for eternity.
.C 
 Right here at Your feet, where I want to be.
.         G
 I am Yours.

[V2]
.G C G C
.G       C           G     C                   G  C
 Love so indelible, to know You're never gonna go,
.           G
 Never gonna go.||
.G       C           G        C
 Love too unthinkable and true
.           G     C             G      C
 For anyone but you, for anyone but you.

[P2]
.D               C
 Or maybe like a match being lit,
.         D
 Or the sinking of a ship,
.        Em           D/F#
 Letting go gives a better grip.

[T]
.    G                 C
 Forever and ever and ever and ever.
.    Em                C
 Forever and ever and ever and ever.|(4X)

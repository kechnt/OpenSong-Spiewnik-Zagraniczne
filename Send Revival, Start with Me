  <lyrics>[V1]
.      C                          F
 We're looking to Your promise of old,
.           C                  F
 That if we pray and humble ourselves,
.         Am                Dm7
 You will come and heal our land, 
.         C              F    (C)
 You will come, You will come.

[V2]
.      C                          F
 We're looking to the promise You made,
.           C                     F
 That if we turn and look to Your face,
.         Am                Dm7
 You will come and heal our land,
.         C              F       C
 You will come, You will come to us.

[C]
.(C)   G/B    Am     F          C
 Lord, send revival, start with me.
.    G/B  Am     F       C
 For I am one of unclean lips,
.       F                  C
 And my eyes have seen the King;
.     F            C
 Your glory I have glimpsed,
.     F C/E   Dm    Fsus2 C
 Send revival start with  me.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.    G                   Em7
 The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty;
.                    C2
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.||
.   G                           Em7
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
.                    C2
 And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice.


[C]
.    G               D/F#
 How great is our God. Sing with me,
.    Em7             D/F#
 How great is our God. All will see
.    C          D            G
 How great, how great is our God.


[V2]
 Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
 Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.||
 The Godhead three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.


[B]
.G              D/F#
 Name above all names.
.Em7           D/F#
 Worthy of all praise.
.   C
 My heart will sing,
.    D            G
 How great is our God. (2X)</lyrics></song>

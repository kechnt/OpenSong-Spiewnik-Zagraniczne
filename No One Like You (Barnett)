[V2]
 There's no one like you in all the earth
 There's no one like you in the heavens
 There's no one like you who sings so sweetly
 Who shines so brighty and is so holy

[C2]
 And I will praise you all my days
 I will praise you as my Savior
 I will praise you in you beauty
 In your power and your glory
 There's no one like you, No one
 There's no one like you, No one</lyrics></song>

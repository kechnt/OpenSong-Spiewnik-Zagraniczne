  <lyrics>[V1]
 I'm aching, transparent.
 Your eyes see right through me.
 I'm dependent and shaking,
 I'm falling to my knees.
 
[P1]
 And I can't contain this.
 You're the only one I need.
 I'm hooked and I cannot hide it.
 Your love's controlling me.
 
[C]
 You're the core of my addiction.
 I want to live, want to lose myself in You.
 You're the heart of my obsession.
 I want to live, but I would die for You.
 I'm addicted.
 
[V2]
 Impulsive, enraptrued,
 This yearning's captured me.
 I'm determined, I'm not pretending.
 You are my destiny.
 
[P2]
 I can feel the freedom.
 You're the only one I need.
 I'm alive and finally breathing.
 You're my recovery.
 
[B]
 God, I've waited for this day.
 I'll never run away.
 And You won't have to chase me.
 
[T]
 I'm addicted
 I'm addicted to You.</lyrics></song>

.Dm        C/E  F2(no3)               C
 Shine for Me.          You shine for Me.

 You shine on. You shine on. You shine for Me.

[C2]
.           D5          
 I love you more than the sun
.        G2(no3)                    Bm
 And the stars that I taught how to shine.

 You are mine, and you shine for me too.||
.          D5               G2(no3)
 I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow; 
.     Bm                 A
 I'll say it again and again:||

 I love you more than the sun
.        G2(no3)                    Bm
 And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                      G
 You are mine, and you shine for me too.||
.          D5               G2(no3)                       Bm
 I love you yesterday and today,  through the joy and the pain, 
.                       A
 I'll say it again and again:

 I love you     more.
.       G2(no3) Bm    D
 I love you     more.||
.G2(no3) Bm  D
   And I see you, and I made you,
.G2(no3) Bm   D.                     G      Bm
   And I love you more than you can imagine,||
.D                 G      
 More than you can fathom.
.Bm   D                  G   Bm 
    I love you more than the sun,
.D                G    Bm  D
 and you shine for  Me.

[V]
.   C     F     C
1It came upon a midnight clear
2Still through the cloven skies they come
3And ye, beneath life's crushing load
4For lo the days are hast'ning on
.     F        D7      G   G7
1That glorious song of old
2With peaceful wings unfurled,
3Whose forms are bending low,
4By prophets seen of old
.     C      F       C
1From angels bending near the earth
2And still their heavenly music floats
3Who toil along the climbing way
4When with the ever-circling years
.   F           G7       C
1To touch their harps of gold
2O'er all the weary world
3With painful steps and slow
4Shall come the time foretold
.       E7                  Am
1"Peace on the earth,  good will to men
2Above its sad and lowly plains
3Look now! for glad and golden hours
4When peace shall over all the earth
.     G            D7       G       G7
1From heaven's all gracious King;"
2They bend on hovering wing;
3Come swiftly on the wing;
4Its ancient splendour fling
.    C        F      C            
1The world in solemn stillness lay,
2And ever o'er its Babel sounds
3O rest beside the weary road
4And all the world give back the song
.   F        G7     C
1To hear the angels sing
2The blessed angels sing
3And hear the angels sing
4Which now the angels sing</lyrics>

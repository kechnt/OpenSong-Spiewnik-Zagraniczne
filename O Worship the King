  <lyrics>[V1]
.  D                     G        A
 O worship the King, all glorious above,
.    D                   G         D
 And gratefully sing His wonderful love.||
.    A                                   G
 Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
.D                              G        D
 Pavillioned in splendor and girded with praise!

[V2]
 O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
 Whose robe is the light and canopy space.||
 His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
 And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

[C]
.G                 A         D
 You alone are the Matchless King.
.G                   A     D
 To You alone be all majesty.
.G 
 Your glories and wonders
.     A            D
 What tongue can recite?
.    G                  D
 You breathe in the air.
.                 G     A
 You shine in the light.

[V3]
 O measureless might, ineffable love,
 While angels delight to worship above.||
 Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!

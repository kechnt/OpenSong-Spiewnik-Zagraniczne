  <lyrics>[V1]
.E    B       C#m           A               E    B
 Stir in me a fire that the world cannot explain;
.          C#m         A
 I come to worship You.
.E    B     C#m7            A               E    B
 Stir in me passion that my heart cannot contain;
.          C#m7        A
 I come to worship You.

[C]
.E        B/D#      C#m7
 Hold me, break me, mold me
.    A                E
 And make me more and more like You;
.B/D#      C#m7        F#m7
 I come to worship You.
.   E         B/D#
 To love You, fear You,
.C#m7      A             E
 Draw ever near You as I worship You;
.B/D#      C#m7       F#m7   E
 I come to worship You    oh Lord.

[B]
.A     E/G#
 Keeper of my heart,
.B     C#m7
 Author of my days,
.A     E/G#
 Shaper of my dreams,
.B       C#m7
 Shepherd of my way,
.A          E/G#
 Take this sacrifice,
.B       C#m7
 Take my yielded life,
.A            E/G#         B
 I come to worship You, oh Lord.
.A              E/G#         D
 I'm here to worship You, oh Lord.
.B

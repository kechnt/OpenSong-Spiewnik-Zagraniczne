  <lyrics>;Tune to Eb

[V]
.       Am
 And he set me on fire and I am burning alive.
.           F
 With his breath in my lungs, I am coming undone. (2X)


[P]
.Em                   Am        G       F
 And I cannot hold it in|and remain composed.
.Em                Am    G     F
 Love's taken over me so I propose
.                                           C
 The letting myself go. I am letting myself go.


[C]
.F 
 You are my joy, You are my joy, 
.                            C  G/B
 You are my joy, You are my joy. (2X)

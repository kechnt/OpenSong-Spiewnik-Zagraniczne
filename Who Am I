[V1]
.       G           D/F#            Em7
 Who am I, that the|Lord of all the earth
.      D               C2          D/C             C
 Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt?||
.       G           D/F#               Em7
 Who am I, that the|Bright and Morning Star
.      D                   C           D/C            C     G/B
 Would choose to light the way, for my ever-wandering heart?

[P]
.      C              Dsus      Em7                  D/F#
 Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done.
.      Em7                D/F#        C                D
 Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are.

[C]
.G      D/F#           Em7            D              C
 I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
.  D                  C              D      G
 A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.||
.          D/F#             Em7
 Still You hear me when I'm calling.
.          D                 C
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.
.           D             C        G     C2      Em7    (G C Em7 Dsus to verse)
 And You've told me who I am: I am Yours.   I am Yours.

[V2]
 Who am I, that the|eyes that see my sin
 Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again?||
 Who am I, that the|voice that calmed the sea
 Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me?

[C2]
 I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow,
 A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.||
 Still You hear me when I'm calling.
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.
.           D             C   D .    Em     D/F#  C  G/B  Am  G  C/E  D/F#    
 And You've told me who I am:   I am Yours.||

 Cause I am Yours,  I am Yours.

  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                                F#m7
 The cross before me, the world behind.
.
 No turning back, raise the banner high.
.Esus         D2                A  Asus  A  
 It's not for me; it's all for You.||
.A                         
 Let the heavens shake and split the sky.
.F#m7
 Let the people clap their hands and cry.
.Esus           D2              A  Asus  A
 It's not for us; it's all for You.

[C]
.A                      G/D  D       G/D D
 Not to us, but to Your name  be the glo_ry.
.A                      G/D  D       G/D D  (A  A2  Dmaj7  D  G/D  D to verse)
 Not to us, but to Your name  be the glo_ry.

[V2]
 Our hearts unfold before Your throne.
 The only place for those who know:
 It's not for us; it's all for You.||
 Send Your holy fire on this offering.
 Let our worship burn for the world to see.
 It's not for us; it's all for You, for You.

[B]
.    A
 The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting;
.D6 D            D6  D
    It's all for You.
.    F#m7                    Esus
 The waves are crashing, the sun is raging;
.D
 It's all for You.||
.    A                                D6
 The universe is spinning and singing;
. D            D6  D
 It's all for You
.       F#m7             Esus
 Your children dancing, dancing, dancing;
.D                              Asus  A  Asus  A  D2  D  Dmaj7 D
 It's all for You; it's all for You.</lyrics></song>

[V1]
 God, You have done great things.
 God, You give grace to the weak
 And bless the brokenhearted
 With a song of praise to sing.

[P]
 You reached down and lifted us up.
 You came running looking for us.
 And now there's nothing
 And no one beyond Your love.

[C]
 You're the overflow,
 You're the fountain of my heart.
 Let Your mercy rain,
 Let Your mercy rain on us.

[C2]
 You're the faithful one
 When the world's falling apart.
 Let Your mercy rain,
 Let Your mercy rain on us.

[B]
 How deep, how wide, how long,
 how high is Your love, is Your love.
 How deep, how wide, how long, 
 How high is Your love,
 Is Your love, oh God.

[T]
 Let it rain.

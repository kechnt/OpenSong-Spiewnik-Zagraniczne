.F#m         A/C D9 A
 I surrender all,
.                       F#m A/C D9 A
 To the promises You've made
.    F#m            A/C D9 A
 And I will give it all,
.                    F#m A/C D9 A
 To the Maker of the day

[V]
.A                         D
1No one knows your         hurt
2Can you hear the sound of laughter
.A                      D
1And No one knows your  fears
2From the other side of life
.A                                 D
1When no one solves the            mystery
2Their are days when I feel like a stranger sometimes
.A                           D
1Or even whipes away the     tears
2Tell me are there any other souls like me

.D9         A                 D9     A
 He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are
.D9      A                  D9     A
 He only loves us 'cause of who He is (2x)</lyrics></song>

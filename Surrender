  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                  D                      C
 I'm giving you my heart and all that is within.
.             Em           D/F#           G
 I lay it all down for the sake of you my king.||
.                  D                          C
 I'm giving you my dreams, I'm laying down my rights,
.                 Em             D/F#           G
 I'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new Life.

 
[C]
.    Em D/F#   G
 And I      surrender
.C       G   Em      D   
 All to you, all to you. (2X)

 
[V2]
.G                    D                        C
 I'm singing you this song, I'm waiting at the cross.
.                        Em      D/F#            G
 And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss||
.                        D                          C
 For the sake of knowing you, for the glory of your name
.                    Em        D/F#            G
 To know the lasting joy, even sharing in your pain.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.             Bm7  G D
 I come on my knees
.              Bm7     G D
 To lay down before you,
.                    Bm7 G D
 Bringing all that I am,
.                Bm7     G D
 Longing only to know you.||
.             Bm7  G D
 Seeking your face,
.                  Bm7  G D
 And not only your hand,
.            Bm7    G D
 I find you embracing me
.          Bm7 G D
 Just as I am.

[P]
.A     Bm7                 G
 And I lift these songs to you and you alone.
.A    Bm7                C
 As I sing to you, in my praises make your home.

[C]
.      G  D        A
 To my audience of one,
.        G       D           A
 You are Father, and You are Son.
.        Bm7    
 As Your Spirit flows free,
.       G
 Let it find within me
.  D/F#       G        A
 A heart that beats to praise you.||
.        G       D        A
 And now just to know you more
.      G       D     A
 Has become my great reward,
.       Bm7
 To see Your kingdom come
.    G
 And Your will be done.
.  D/F#   G          A          Bm7 G D
 I only desire to be Yours, Lord.
---
[V2]
 So what could I bring
 To honor your majesty?
 What song could I sing
 That would move the heart of royalty?||
 And all that I have
 Is the life that You've given me.
 So Lord let me live for You,
 This song with humility.

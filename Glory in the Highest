[V1]
 You are the first.
 You go before.
 You are the last;
 Lord, You're the encore.
 Your name's in lights for all to see.
 The starry host declare Your glory.

[C]
 Glory in the highest.
 Glory in the highest.
 Glory in the highest.

[V2]
 Apart from You, 
 There is no God,
 Light of the world,
 The Bright and Morning Star.
 Your Name will shine for all to see.
 You are the One; You are my Glory.

[B]
 And no one else
 Could ever compare to You, Lord.
 All the earth together declares:

[C2]
 Glory in the highest!
 Glory in the highest!
 Glory in the highest to You, Lord!
 To You, Lord!

[T]
 All the earth will sing Your praise.
 The moon and stars, the sun and rain,
 Every nation will proclaim
 That You are God and You will reign.||
 Glory, glory, hallelujah!
 Glory, glory, to You, Lord!
 Glory, glory, hallelujah!
 Hallelujah!

D  Dsus I've walked against the water,    now I'm waiting if You please..D                         G2  G/A .                     D We've longed to see the roses,    but never felt the thorns,.                        G2   G/A .

G                        D/F#       A Find me on my knees with my soul laid bare.. G                                D/F#       A Even though You're gone and I'm cracked and dry,.    Bm             G2              G/A  (D Dsus D to verse) Find me in the river. I'm waiting here.  [V2] Find me in the river, find me on my knees. I've walked against the water, now I'm waiting if You please. We didn't count on suffering, we didn't count on pain, But if the blessing's in the valley, then in the river we'll wait. [T].     D Dsus D For You </lyrics></song>

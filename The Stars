.D
 Maybe I've been the problem.
.      G              D
 Maybe I'm the one to blame.
.                C               G
 But even when I turn it off and blame myself, 
.    A                 A7
 The outcome feels the same.||
.                         D
 I've been thinking maybe I've been partly cloudy.
.      G                 D
 Maybe I'm the chance of rain.
.              C
 And maybe I'm overcast,
.    G            A                      A7
 And maybe all my luck's washed down the drain.

[P]
.                         G
 I've been thinking 'bout everyone,
.A                  Bm       C
 Everyone you look so lonely.

[C] 
.                       D
 But when I look at the stars,
.                   G
 When I look at the stars,
.                   C   A                D    G
 When I look at the stars, I see someone else. 
.                   D
 When I look at the stars,
.    G   A                   D A
 The stars, I feel like myself.

[V2]
.D
 Stars looking at a planet,
.         G           D
 Watching entropy and pain,
.                   C
 And maybe start to wonder 
.        G            A                   A7
 How the chaos in our lives could pass as sane.||
.                             D
 I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of resistance,
.     G               D
 Of a hope beyond our own,
.                 C            G
 And suddenly the infinite and penitent 
.    A              A7
 Begin to look like home.

[T]
.G         A              Bm        D
 Everyone, everyone feels so lonely.
.G              A              Bm       G
 Everyone, yeah everyone feels so empty. 
.                   D
 When I look at the stars,
.                   G
 When I look at the stars,
.                   C    A             D      G
 When I look at the stars, I feel like myself. 
.                   D
 When I look at the stars,
.    G   A        D
 The stars, I see someone...</lyrics></song>

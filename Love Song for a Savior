.Cmaj7 Dsus Gsus G Em Dsus G Gsus

[V1] 
.Em     Dsus            Gsus G  Em            Dsus               G
 In open fields of wild flowers, she breathes the air and flies away.
.G                            Em              Dsus  G
 She thanks her Jesus for the daisies and the roses in no simple language.
.Em      Dsus             G
 Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all.

[P1]
.Fsus                                G            Gsus
 He is more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens,  
.   Fsus                    G           Gsus  G
 As close as a heartbeat or song on her lips.||
.Fsus                      G
 Someday she'll trust Him, learn how to see Him.
.Fsus                       Am7
 Someday He'll call her and she will come running
.    Abmaj7                Em7             Dsus            G
 And fall in His arms, the tears will fall down and she'll pray,

[C]
.G         C2                Am7
 I want to fall in love with You.
.          Em7     Dsus      G
 I want to fall in love with You.
.          C2                Am7
 I want to fall in love with You.
.          Em7     Dsus      Em7
 I want to fall in love with You-
.D   G             Em7 D   G
 hoo-hoo! Ooo-hoo! You-hoo-hoo!

[V2]
.Em  D                  Gsus       G Em      Dsus                G
 Sitting silent wearing Sunday best.  The sermon echoes thru the walls;
.G                         Em           Dsus       G
 A great salvation thru it calls to the people|who stare into nowhere,
.Em             Dsus            G
 Can't feel the chains on their souls.

[P2]
.Fsus                                G            Gsus
 He is more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens,  
.   Fsus                    G           Gsus  G
 As close as a heartbeat or song on our lips.
.Fsus                     G
 Someday we'll trust Him, learn how to see Him.
.Fsus                      Am7
 Someday He'll call us and we will come running 
.    Abmaj7                Em7             Dsus           G
 And fall in His arms, the tears will fall down and we'll pray,

[B]
.         Em7 (D G)
 Ooo-hoo! You...
.Em7  D       G
 We   want to pray!  Hi-gh!
.Am7      G        Em
 La la la la la la la, a
.      Dsus      Am7
 La la la, la la la, 
.      G        Em
 La la la la la la la, 
.         D
 La la la-ah.||
.Em        Dsus                 G      Em         Dsus                G
  It seems too easy to call You Savior, not close enough to call You "God".
.G                             Em          Dsus       G               Em  Dsus  D  G
  So as I sit and think of the words I can mention to show my devotion,

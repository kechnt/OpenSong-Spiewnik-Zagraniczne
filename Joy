[Intro]
.D                          A
 You give me joy that's unspeakable
.       Em            G
 And I like it, and I like it.
.D                      A
 Your love for me's irrestible;
.        Em                G
 I can't fight it, I can't fight it.

[V1] 
.                         G                A
 If life is water, I was dry as the Tucson dirt.
.                          G             A
 If it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt.||
.                           G              A      
 If it's a journey, I was dazed without a clue.
.                            G                 A
 I flipped a "U" back to the first love I ever knew.

[C]
.D                          A
 You give me joy that's unspeakable
.      Em             G
 And I like it, and I like it.
.D                      A
 Your love for me's irrestible;
.        Em                G 
 I can't fight it, I can't fight it.||
.D                          A
 You carried the cross and took my shame;
.    Em            G 
 I believe it, I believe it.
.D                         A
 You shine your light of amazing grace;
.    Em            G
 I receive it, I receive it.

[V2]
.                           G            A
 If life's a battle, the invasion is complete.
.                            G               A            
 If it's a rhythm, I have found the perfect beat.||
.                            G              A  
 If it's a Renaissance, I've got a new birthday.
.                 G                                   A
 The world don't give it and the world can't take it away.

[B]
.Em                       A
 I'm bowed and broken, everything's new.
.Em                            A  
 All that I need, you're like water to seed.||
.                            G
 And how your love rights everything wrong,
.         A                   G
 In my weakness you're ever stronger,
.                          A
 Pulling me back where I belong.</lyrics></song>

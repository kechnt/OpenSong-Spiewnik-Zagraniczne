F There you will find what you need..C Give Me your life, the lust and the lies,.                               F The past you're afraid I might see..            A#                G You've been running away from Me.  [C].            Am  F            C     G You're my beloved, lover I'm yours..                Am      F                G Death shall not part us; it's you I died for..              Am  F                C  G For better or worse, forever we'll be..             Am       F                    G Our love it unites us, and it binds you to Me;.            Am  F  C  G It's a mystery.  [V2] Love of My life, look deep in My eyes; There you will find what you need. I'm the Giver of Life, I'll clothe you in white; My immaculate bride you will be. Oh, come running home to Me.  [B].            F                   C Well you've been a mistress, My wife..               Am           G          Am You're chasing lovers, that won't satisfy..          F/G                Am Won't you let Me make you My bride?.         F                           G You will drink of my lips and you'll taste new life.</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>;Verses 1 &amp; 2 before Chorus

[V]
.            D                      Am
1            I put my hope in       You
2It's the Creator calling the cre___ated
3It's no     secret that we don't belong here
.      C                               D
1I     lay my life in the palm of Your hand
2The   Maker beckoning the             made
3Those set apart by the grace of       You
.          C                         G
1For       I am constantly           drawn to You Lord
2The bride finding what she's always waited for
3And we    look for the day when we  go to a place
.          C                    A    1: D Am C G
1In        ways I cannot compre_hend
2When we   find ourselves that  day
3Where the old becomes... brand new

[C]
.   D                                 G
 In You where the hungry feast at the table
.          D                   G
 The blind frozen by colors in view
.              D                                 G
 The lame will dance, They'll dance for they are able
.        C
 And the weary find rest
.       A                  D    Am C G
 Oh the weary find rest in You

[End]

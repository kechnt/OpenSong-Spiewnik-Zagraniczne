.D      G             D             G
 I will call upon the Lord, (I will call upon the Lord,)
.D      G            D                G            D
 Who is worthy to be praised; (Who is worthy to be praised;)
.D        G    D             G            D             G
 So shall I be saved from my enemies; (Be saved from my enemies;)

 I will call upon the Lord.

[C]
.    D                G              D
 The Lord liveth, and blessed be the rock,
.            G            D         A7
 And let the God of my salvation be exalted;
.    D                G              D
 The Lord liveth, and blessed be the rock,
.            G            D         A7     D
 And let the God of my salvation be exalted.

[V2]
.D      G                 D            G                 D
 I will learn to trust in Him, (I will learn to trust in Him,)
.D       G               D             G               D
 He will save me from my sin; (He will save me from my sin;)
.D        G    D             G                D             G
 So shall I proclaim him the Lord of all, (Proclaim him the Lord of all,)
.D      G                  D
 I will learn to trust the Lord.</lyrics>

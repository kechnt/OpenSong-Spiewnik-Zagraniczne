  <lyrics>[V1] 
.C#m
 Take my hands, take my feet.
.C#m
 Take the music to the street.

 Hear the prayers, feel the sound: 
.  C#m                B
 A generation Kingdom bound.

 Great and glorious! Is my Savior! 

[C]
.A             E              C#m
 Praises on my tongue from my heart
.        B              A
 For our God who became flesh. 
.       E         C#m
 For us all, unto You,

 I will sing Your praises, sing forever!   

[V2]
.C#m
 Take my will, take my all.

 Wrap my life around Your call.

 Set apart to sing Your praise,

 To live the difference in these days.

 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, to sing aloud, sing aloud!

 All, for the glory of my God and King! 
.A         E                   B
 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing!

  <lyrics>;CAPO 4

[V1]
.          Em9                C               G                   D5
 There's a peace I've come to know,|though my heart and flesh may fail.
.           Em9           C           G           D
 There's an anchor for my soul;|I can say, "It is well."

[P]
.G             D/F#          Em7          C2
 Jesus has overcome,|and the grave is overwhelmed.
.    G/B        Dsus  D .     Em9            C2
 The victory is won;|   He is risen from the dead!

[C]
.           G2           Dadd4          Em9             C2
 And I will rise when He calls my name.|No more sorrow, no more pain.
.       G2      Dadd4             Em9              C2              G2
 I will rise on eagle's wings,|before my God, fall on my knees and rise.
.       G/D   D
 I will rise.

[V2]
.          Em9                C2             Gmaj7              Dadd4
 There's a day that's drawing near|when this darkness breaks to light,
.        Em9          C2           Gmaj7             Dadd4
 And the shadows disappear,|and my faith shall be my eyes.

[B]
.               C2       G    D             C2     G      D
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing, "Worthy is the Lamb!"
.               C2      G    D               C2     G      D
 And I hear the cry of ev'ry longing heart, "Worthy is the Lamb!"
.               C2       G    D             C2     G      D
 And I hear the voice of many angels sing, "Worthy is the Lamb!"
.               C2      G    D       Em7     C2     G      D
 And I hear the cry of ev'ry longing heart, "Worthy is the Lamb!"
. C2     G      D      G2  Dadd4  Em7  C2
 "Worthy is the Lamb!"

[T]
.       G/D   C2/E
 I will rise.
.       G/D   Dadd4  G
 I will rise.</lyrics>

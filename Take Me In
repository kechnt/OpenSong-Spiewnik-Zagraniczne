  <lyrics>[V]
.Em                                Cmaj7
 Take me past the outer courts and thru the holy place,
.D                              Em               Cmaj7 D
 Past the brazen altar; Lord, I want to see Your face;||
.Em                                       Cmaj7
 Pass me by the crowds of people, and the priests who sing their praise;
.  D
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,
.        Am7            Cmaj7 D
 But its only found one place.


[C]
.           Em                D/E
 So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
.        Am7       Am7/D        Em   Cmaj7 D
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb;
.           Em                D/E
 So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
.         Am7   Am7/D      D            Em
 Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.</lyrics>

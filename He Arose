  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                        D        G
 Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Savior!
.C           G           Em  A7     D
 Waiting the coming day, Je__sus my Lord!

[C]
.            G
 (Spirited!) Up from the grave He arose,
.              C                G
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
.    D                      G    C G
 He arose a victor from the dark domain,
.       C        A7            D      A7 D7
 And He lives forever with His saints to reign,
.    G         C          G      D       G
 He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

[V2]
.G                          D        G
 Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Savior!
.C           G              Em  A7     D
 Vainly they seal the dead, Je__sus my Lord!

[V3]
.G                           D        G
 Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus my Savior!
.C           G          Em  A7     D
 He tore the bars away, Je__sus my Lord!</lyrics></song>

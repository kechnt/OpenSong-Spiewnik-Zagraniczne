.              A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  E
 Down in my heart, down in my heart.
.        A
 Where?  Down in my heart.
.     E        A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  Bm         E7       A  A7
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay.

[C]		
.           D              A
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
.     E                           A    A7
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.
.           D              A
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
.     E                           A  D  A  E
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.

[V2]
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart, down in my heart.
 Where?  Down in my heart.
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay.</lyrics>

[V1]
.Em          D       G   Em             D             G
 Magnificent, Holy Father,  I stand in awe of all I see.
.C                G             Em  C                                   D
 Of all the things You have created, and still You choose to think of me.


[V2]
.Em         D                    G  Em             D               G
 And who am I that You should suffer   Your very life to set me free?
.C             G              Em    C          G                D
 The only thing that I can give You   is the life You gave to me.


[C]
.             C               G               C                D
 This is my offering, dear Lord. This is my offering to You, God.
.       Em             D           G             C
 I will give You my life, for it's all I have to give,
.                        D        Em  D  G  Em  D/F#  G
 Because You gave Your life for me.


[V3]
.Em           D               G  Em            D              G
 I stand before You at this altar;  so many have given You more.
.C           G               Em  C              G               D
 I may not have much I can offer,  yet what I have is truly Yours.</lyrics>

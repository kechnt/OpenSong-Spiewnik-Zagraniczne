  <lyrics>[V1]
.      D         G           D
 Go on up to the mountain of mercy,
.       D          G      D
 To the crimson perpetual tide.
.      A 
 Kneel down on the shore
.       G
 And be thirsty no more;
.   D         A         D
 Go under and be purified.


[V2]
 Follow Christ to the holy mountain,
 Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall.
 Cleanse your heart and your soul
 In the fountain that flows
 For you and for me and for all.


[C]
.       A                   G       D
 At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree,
.        A                    G             D
 On that beautiful scandalous night You and me
.     A             F#m7 
 Were atoned by His blood
.    Bm             G
 And forever washed white
.        D         A          D
 On that beautiful scandalous night


[V3]
 On the hillside you will be delivered,
 At the foot of the cross justified
 And your spirit restored
 By the river that pours
 From our blessed Savior's side.</lyrics>

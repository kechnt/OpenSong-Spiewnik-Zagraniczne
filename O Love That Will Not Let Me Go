[V1]
.  G         D        C      G   D
 O Love that will not let me go,
.  Em      G     C       D
 I rest my weary soul in thee;
.  G         D        C      G   D
 I give thee back the life I owe,
.     Em       G     C          D
 That in thine ocean depths its flow
.     Am      Em    D   C G D
 May richer, fuller be.


[V2]
 O Light that follows all my way,
 I yield my flickering torch to thee;
 My heart restores its borrowed ray,
 That in thy sunshine's blaze its day
 May brighter, fairer be.


[V3]
 O Joy that seekest me through pain,
 I cannot close my heart to thee;
 I trace the rainbow through the rain,
 And feel the promise is not vain,
 That morn shall tearless be.


[V4]
 O Cross that liftest up my head,
 I dare not ask to fly from thee;
 I lay in dust life's glory dead,
 And from the ground there blossoms red
 Life that shall endless be.</lyrics></song>

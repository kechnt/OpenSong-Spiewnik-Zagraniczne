  <lyrics>[V1]
.C          G          Am
 When I was held up in chains
.    F         C
 The river was free.
.           G          Am
 When I was covered in stains
.    F         C
 The river was clean.
.           G         Am
 When I was losing my way
.    F     C        G Am
 The river found me.

[C1]
.              C     F
 I can see the river.
.      Dm             Dm3 Dm
 I can feel the river.
.                  Am           F
 I'm letting go of all I hold onto.
.             C
 Let it wash away.

[V2]
.             G        Am
 When we were broken inside
.    F         C
 The river was love.
.             G           Am
 When we were thirsty and dry
.         F          C
 You were more than enough.
.             G           Am
 When we were drowning in lies
.    F          C   G Am
 The river saved us.

[C2]
.                   C     F
 I'm dancing in the river.
.            Dm           Dm3 Dm
 And I'll be here forever.
.                  Am             F
 I'm letting go of everything but You.||
---
.          C
 Carry me away.
.          G
 Carry me away.
.          Am
 Carry me away.
.          G
 Carry me away.
.          Am
 Carry me away.
.          G
 Carry me away.

[T]
.                        C F Dm Am
 And I can see the river!
.     F           C
 It's washin' me away.
.                  C     F
 My life is in the river.
.                    Dm   Dm3 Dm
 And I'll be here forever.
.                  Am                F
 I'm lettin' go of all that I hold onto.||
.                C      F
 Can you see the river?
.                            Dm    Dm3 Dm
 When you're standin' in the river,
.              F
 Letting go of everything,
.               C
 Everything but You.

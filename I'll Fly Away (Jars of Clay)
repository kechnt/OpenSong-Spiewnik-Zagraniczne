  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                         C         G
 Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away!
.G                                   G    C    G
 To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.


[C]
.G                        C         G
 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away;
.G                Dsus         Em
 When I die, hallelujah by and by,
.G    C    G
 I'll fly away.


[V2]
.G                                        C         G
 When the shadows of this life have gone, I'll fly away!
.G                                       G    C    G
 Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away.


[V3]
.G                                   C         G
 Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away!
.G                                      G    C    G
 No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away!


[V4]
.G                                    C         G
 Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away!
.G                                     G    C    G
 To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away.</lyrics></song>

.D  D/A  D/Em  D/G  Em  A  

[V1]
.Bm                             G            Bm                         G
 An image flashed across my TV screen.|Another broken heart comes into view.
.Bm                      G                   D                          G
 I saw the pain, and I turned my back.|Why can't I do the things I want to?||
.A                     Em             A  
 I am willing, yet I'm so afraid; You give me strength when I say...


[C] 
.D                                             D/A
 I want to be Your hands. I want to be Your feet.
.D/Em                                      D/G
 I'll go where You send me, go where You send me.||
.D                                             D/A
 I want to be Your hands, I want to be Your feet.
.D/Em                                      D/G
 I'll go where You send me, go where You send me
.Em              A           D                            A    G   
 And I'll try, yeah I'll try to touch the world, like You touched my life,
.      Em             A                                   
 And I'll find my way to be Your hands.


[V2] 
.Bm                       G                  Bm                         G  
 I've abandoned every selfish thought; I've surrendered everything I've got.
.Bm                      G         D                          G
 You can have everything I am and perfect everything I'm not.
.A                     Em         A      
 I am willing, I'm not afraid. You give me strength when I say


[B] 
.A                              G
 This is the last time I turn my back from You.
.E                                       G
 From now on I'll go out, send me where You want me to.
.A                                   G
 I finally have a mission, I promise I'll complete.
.E                                          G
 I don't need excuses when I am your hands and feet.</lyrics></song>

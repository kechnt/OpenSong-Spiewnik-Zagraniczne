  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                   G    A		D
 There is a longing, only You can fill;
.F#m      Bm7     G	          G/A   A   
 A raging tempest only You can still.
.Bm         Bm/A                G               D/F#
 My soul is thirsting, Lord, to know You as I'm known;
.Em7            D/F#       G                 G/A
 Drink from the river that flows before Your throne

[C]
.A       D     F#m7	       Bm7      Bm7/A
 Take me deeper, deeper in love with You; 
.Em7            D/F#	           G/A
 Jesus, hold me close in Your embrace.
.A       D	  A/C#              Bm        Bm/A
 Take me deeper, deeper than I've ever been before;
.               G                 D/F#
 I just want to love You more and more,
.      Em7        G/A A	 D
 How I long to be deeper in love

[V2]
.D                   G      A         D
 Sunrise to sunrise, I will seek Your face;
.F#m          Bm7           G               G/A   A   
 Drawn by the Spirit to the promise of Your grace.
.Bm           Bm/A           G              D/F#
 My heart has found in You a hope that will abide;
.Em7          D/F#          G         G/A
 Here in Your presence, for ever satisfied.</lyrics>

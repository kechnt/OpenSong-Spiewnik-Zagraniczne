  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Em                   Cmaj7                 Em                          Cmaj7
 Is it true today that when people pray|cloudless skies will break, kings and queens will shake?||
.          D             C                        G   D/F# Em7 C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it:|I'm living for You.

[V2]
.      Em                    Cmaj7                 Em                     Cmaj7
 Is it true today, that when people pray|we'll see dead men rise, and the blind set free?||
.          D             C                        G   D/F#        Em7 C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it:|I'm living for You, living for You.

[C]
.G                      Em            C
 I'm gonna be a history maker in this land,
.G                         Em              C
 I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind;||
.G            D/F# Em           C          G   D/F#
 I'm gonna stand,  I'm gonna run into Your arms,
.          Em    C
 Into Your arms again,
.          G   D/F#        Em    C
 Into Your arms, into Your arms again.

[V3]
.      Em                    Cmaj7                 Em                  Cmaj7
 Is it true today, that when people stand|with the fire of God and the truth in hand,||
.          Em                  Cmaj7                  Em                   Cmaj7
 We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing,|we'll see broken hearts making history?||
.          D             C                        G   D/F#        Em7 C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it,|I'm living for You, living for You.</lyrics>

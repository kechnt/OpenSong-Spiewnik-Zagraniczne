.G        C          D         G
 How many times have I turned away?
.    C             G           D
 The number is the same as the sand on the shore.||
.G     C            D        G
 Every time, you've taken me back,
.    C              D          G
 And now I pray you do it once more.


[C]
.       G               C
 Please take from me my life,
.     Am               B
 When I don't have the strength
.   G        Am     D
 To give it away to you.||
.       G               C
 Please take from me my life,
.     Am               B
 When I don't have the strength
.   C        Am          D G   G C D G
 To give it away to you, Jesus.


[V2]
.G        C          D       G
 How many times have I gone astray?
.    C             G           D
 The number is the same as the stars in the sky.||
.G         C           D        G
 But every time you've taken me back,
.    C              D       G
 And now I pray you do it tonight.


[T]
.   C        Am         D G   G C D G G C D G
 To give it away to you Jesus.</lyrics></song>

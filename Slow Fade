  <lyrics>[V1]
.   Am                           C
 Be careful little eyes what you see;
.         G                                     Dm
 It's the second glance that ties your hands as darkness pulls the strings.||
.   Am                            C
 Be careful little feet where you go,
.             G                               Dm
 For it's the little feet behind you that are sure to follow.

[C]
.       Am                 G
 It's a slow fade when you give yourself away.
.       Dm             F
 It's a slow fade when black and white have turned to gray.||
.Am               G                   C
 Thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid
.         F
 When you give yourself away.
.Dm                        G
 People never crumble in a day.

[B1]
.       Am      C         Dm      F
 It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade.

[V2]
 Be careful little ears what you hear;
 When flattery leads to compromise, the end is always near.||
 Be careful little lips what you say,
 For empty words and promises lead broken hearts astray.

[B2]
.    Dm                                   F
 The journey from your mind to your hands
.                       Am    G
 Is shorter than you're thinking.||
.   Dm                              F
 Be careful if you think you stand;
.                  C    F
 You just might be sinking.

[T]
.Dm                         G
 Daddies never crumble in a day.||
.Dm                          G
 Families never crumble in a day.||
.
 Oh be careful little eyes what you see,
.
 Oh be careful little eyes what you see,||
.
 For the Father up above is looking down in love.
.
 Oh be careful little eyes what you see.</lyrics></song>

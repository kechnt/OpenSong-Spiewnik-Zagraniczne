[V]
.D                                  G/D
1Did you feel the mountains tremble?   Did you hear the oceans roar
2Did you feel the people tremble?      Did you hear the singers roar
3Do you feel the darkness tremble      when all the saints join in one song,
.Em7                                  Dsus                 A7sus  D   A7sus D A7sus
1When the people rose to sing of|        Jesus Christ, the Risen  One?
2When the lost began to sing of|         Jesus Christ, the Saving One?
3And all the streams flow as one river|  to wash away our  broken_ness?


[P]
.D           G                     D                 G                   D
2And we can  see that, God, You're moving,|A mighty  river through the nations,
3And here we see that, God, You're moving;|A time of jubilee is        coming,
.               G                  D
2And young and  old will turn to Jesus...
3When young and old return to    Jesus...
.Em7                            G                        Asus  D   Asus D
2Fling wide, you heavenly gates;| Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
3Fling wide, you heavenly gates;| Prepare the way of the risen Lord.

.D                     G/B
 Open up the doors and let the music play.
.Em7                          D        A7sus
 Let the streets resound with singing:
.D                              G/B
 Songs that bring Your hope and songs that bring Your joy,
.Em7                         D    A7sus D 
 Dancers who dance upon injustice.</lyrics>

[V]
.    A          B         C#m                      A        B         C#m
1    I keep     trying to find a life on my        own a____part from You;
2The disease of self runs through my blood, it's a cancer fatal to my soul;
.A        B             C#m                A                   B               C#m
1I am the king of ex____cuses; I've got    one for every       selfish thing I do.
2Every at_tempt on my behalf has failed to bring this sickness under con_______trol.


[P]
.A            B    C#m             A        B     C#m
 What's going on inside of me? I despise my own behavior;
.          A            B    C#m                    A              B         C#m
 This only serves to confirm my suspicions that I'm still a man in need of a Savior.


[C]
.        A         E        B              C#m
 I wanna be in the light as You are in the light.
.        A              E            B 
 I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens.
.   A           E          B        C#m
 Oh Lord, be my light, and be my salvation,
.       A             B            C#m   
 'Cause all I want is to be in the light, 
.A             B            C#m
 All I want is to be in the light.</lyrics>

.C     D       G    G2/B
 Father of creation, 
.C               D        G  G2/B
 Unfold Your sov'reign plan;
.C             D        Em  D
 Raise up a chosen generation
.A7m                            Dsus D G/B
 That will march through the land.||
.C         D           G    G2/B
 All of creation is longing
.C          D              G  G2/B
 For Your unveiling of pow'r.
.C              D            Em D
 Would You release Your anointing?
.Am7                        Dsus D
 Oh God, let this be the hour.

[C]
.           G     D/G          C/E G/D
 Let Your glory fall in this room.
.         C             G/B        Dsus   D
 Let it go forth from here to the nations.
.             G       D/G           C/E G/D
 Let Your fragrance rest in this place
.       Am7      Dsus  D  G    G/B
 As we gather to seek Your face.

[V2]
 Ruler of the nations,
 The world has yet to see
 The full release of Your promise,
 The church in victory.||
 Turn to us, Lord, and touch us;
 Make us strong in Your might.
 Overcome our weakness,
 That we could stand up and fight.

[B]
.F           C       G               C/E    F
 Let Your kingdom come (Let Your kingdom come)
.            C       G                C/E   F
 Let Your will be done (Let Your will be done)
.         C       G              C/E
 Let us see on earth (Let us see on earth)
.F         C        Dsus D (Em7 to Bridge)
 The glory of Your Son

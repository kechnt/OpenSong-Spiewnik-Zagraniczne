.    G              D/F#
 Oh, I could sing unending songs
.   Em7              C
 Of how You saved my soul.
.      G               D/F#
 Well, I could dance a thousand miles
.   Em7                C    N.C.
 Because of Your great love.

 My heart is bursting, Lord,
.D/F#
 To tell of all You've done:
.C2sus                          G/B            D
 Of how You changed my life and wiped away the past.||
.G
 I wanna shout it out,
.D/F#
 From every rooftop sing,
.Csus                       G/B         Dsus   D
 For now I know that God is for me not against me.

 Everybody's dancing now|'cause we're so happy.||

 If only we could see Your face

 And see You smile over us,
.    Am
 And unseen angels celebrate

 For joy is in this place!</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.G           C
 What day is it?
.G/F#        G/B
 And in what month?
.     Em          D         C
 This clock never seemed so alive.
.G            C
 I can't keep up,
.    G/F#         G/B
 And I can't back down;
.          Em   D         C
 I've been losing so much time.

[C1]
.            G       C
 'Cause it's you and me
.    G/B
 And all of the people
.     C          G
 With nothing to do,
.C          D
 Nothing to lose.||
.         G       C
 And it's you and me
.    G/B
 And all of the people,
.    G            C
 And I don't know why 
.  C             D           C
 I can't keep my eyes off of you.

[V2]
 What other things
 That I wanna say
 Just aren't coming out right.
 I'm tripping on words;
 You've got my head spinning.
 I don't know where to go from here.

[C2]
 'Cause it's you and me
 And all of the people
 With nothing to do,
 Nothing to prove.||
 And it's you and me
 And all of the people,
 And I don't know why
 I can't keep my eyes off of you.

[B]
.           C
 Something about you now
.G       G/B          C
 I can't quite figure out.
.Em                     D
 Everything she does is beautiful,
.Em                     C   C/D Cm C/D
 Everything she does is right.

[C3]
 'Cause it's you and me
 And all of the people
 With nothing to do,
 Nothing to lose.||
 And it's you and me
 And all of the people,
 And I don't know why 
.  C             D           
 I can't keep my eyes off of...|
.G       C
 you and me||
 And all of the people
 With nothing to do,
 Nothing to prove.||
 And it's you and me
 And all of the people,
 And I don't know why
 I can't keep my eyes off of you.

[T]
.G           C
 What day is it?
.G/F#        G/B
 And in what month?
.     Em          D         C
 This clock never seemed so alive.

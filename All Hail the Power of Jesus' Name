1All hail the pow'r of Jesus'   name, Let angels   pros_trate fall!
2Ye  chosen   seed of  Israel's race, Ye  ransomed from the   fall,
3Let every kindred,    every  tribe,|On  this   terres__trial ball
4O   that with yonder  sacred throng|We at His     feet may   fall.

1Bring forth the royal     dia____dem,      And crown Him  Lord o____f  all.

  <lyrics>[V1]
.          Em7              B7
 Those who trust in the Lord   are a strong mountain;
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 They will not, not be moved. (2X)

[V2]
.          Em7              B7
 Those who trust in the Lord   are as Mount Zion;
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 They will not, not be moved. (2X)

[V3]
.           Em7                  B7
 Christ the King, He sets my feet   on a firm foundation
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 That will not, not be moved. (2X)

[C]
.           C                B7
 Though the world moves like mad,
.                     Em7
 You, O Lord, are faithful;
.D2/F#  G             C           B7
 Jesus, You, You will not, not be changed.</lyrics></song>

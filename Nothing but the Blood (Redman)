  <lyrics>[V1]
.     B2                    G#m7
 Your blood speaks a better word
.                    B2                         G#m7
 Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth
.                         F#
 Speaks righteousness for me
.                    E
 and stands in my defence
.                  B2 G#m7 F#
 Jesus it's your blood

[C]
.B2
 What can wash away our sins?
.G#m7
 What can make us whole again?
.F#
 Nothing but the blood
.E                        B2   F# E
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus||
.B2
 What can wash us pure as snow?
.G#m7
 Welcomed as the friends of God?
.F#
 Nothing but your blood
.E                           B2
 Nothing but your blood King Jesus

[V2]
.     B2                 G#m7
 Your cross testifies in grace
.                      B2                      G#m7
 Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us
.                F#
 Now boldly we approach
.                    E
 Not by earthly confidence
.                  B2 G#m7 F#
 It's only by Your blood</lyrics>

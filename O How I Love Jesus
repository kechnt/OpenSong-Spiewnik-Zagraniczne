  <lyrics>[V1]
.      E    A/E                    B                 E
 There is a name I love to hear. I love to sing it's worth.
.   E           A/E   E     C#m       F#m     B    B7  E - A/B
 It sounds like music in my ear, the sweetest name on earth.

[C]
.E   A/E        E      B             E         A/E        E     C#m
 Oh, How I love Jesus, Oh how I love Jesus, Oh How I love Jesus
.   F#m     B     B7    E
 Because He first loved me.

[V2]
 It tells me of a Saviour's love who died to set me free.
 It tells me of His precious blood, the sinners perfect plea.

[V3]
 It tells me what my Father hath in store for every day,
 And tho' I tread a darksome path, yields sunshine all the way.

[V4]
 It tells of One whose loving heart can feel my deepest woe,
 Who in each sorrow bears a part that none can bear below.</lyrics>

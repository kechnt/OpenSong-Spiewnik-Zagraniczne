[V1]
 You have my heart, and I am Yours forever.
 You are my strength, God of grace and power.

[P]
 And ev'rything|You hold in Your hand.
 Still You make time for me; I can't understand.

[C]
 Praise You, God of earth and sky;
 How beautiful is Your unfailing love,
 Unfailing love.||
 And You never change,
 God, You remain the Holy One, 
 And my unfailing love, unfailing love.

[V2]
 You are my rock, the One I hold on to.
 You are my song, and I sing for You.

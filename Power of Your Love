  <lyrics>[V1]
.G       D/F#    Em   Em/D            Bm         Em
 Lord, I come to You, let my heart be changed, renewed,
.D                C             D        Em  D/F#
 Flowing from the grace that I found in You.||
.G          D/F#    Em       Em/D         Bm     Em
 Lord, I've come to know the weaknesses I see in me
.D                 C   D                     G    G7
 Will be stripped away |by the power of Your love.
 

[C]
.   C    Em D                       C     G  D/F#
 So hold me close, let Your love surround me;
.C     Em D                     G     G7
 Bring me near, draw me to Your side.||
.    C  Em D                           C G
 And as I  wait, I'll rise up like the eagles,
.    D/F#             Em        D               C
 And I will soar with You; Your Spirit leads me on
.       D             G
 In the power of Your love.

 
[V2]
.G       D/F#    Em                   Bm      Em
 Lord, unveil my eyes, let me see You face to face,
.    D                 C           D       Em  D/F#
 The knowledge of Your love as You live in me.||
.G       D/F#   Em                  Bm          Em
 Lord, renew my mind as Your will unfolds in my life,
.   D            C   D                     G    G7
 In living every day |in the power of Your love.</lyrics>

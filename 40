  <lyrics>[V1]
.  E
 I waited patiently for the Lord;
.     A 
 He inclined and heard my cry.
.   E
 He brought me up out of the pit, 
.    A 
 out of the miry clay.


[C]
.       E              A
 I will sing, sing a new song.
.       E              A
 I will sing, sing a new song.
.      E                 A
 How long to sing this song?
.      E                 A
 How long to sing this song?
.      E         A         B
 How long, how long, how long,
.      A                 E 
 How long to sing this song?


[V2]
.   E
 He set my feet upon a rock,
.    A 
 and made my footsteps firm.
.  E
 Many will see, 
.          A 
 Many will see and fear.</lyrics></song>

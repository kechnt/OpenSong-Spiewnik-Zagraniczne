  <lyrics>[V1]
 Raindrops rollin' off my brim
 Streetlights got the pavement glistenin'
 Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
 Right where I belong
 Your everlasting arms

[V2]
 And where would I be
 Without You... 

[V3]
 I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
 It's true
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 Don't know where I'd be without You

[V4]
 Flashback, stepping through the scene
 There's You and there's a very different me
 Touchdown, You had me at belief
 You had me at belief, You did

[V5]
 And where would I be
 Without You, without You... 

[V6]
 I'd be packin' my bags when I need to stay
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
 It's true
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 Without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without
 Without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without You-ou-ou-uo-ou-ou

[V7]
 Don't know where I'd be without You

 (Where would I be...)

[V8]
[WHISPERING]
 (I was so deep, 
 So incomplete
 Til' You rescued me
 Yeah, You rescued me)

[V9]
 Packin' my bags when I need to stay
 I'd be chasin' every breeze that blows my way
 I'd be building my kingdom just to watch it fade away
 It's so true
 Me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
 That's me without 
 That's me without You-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou

 Don't know where I'd be without You

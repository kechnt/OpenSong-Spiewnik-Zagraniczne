  <lyrics>;CAPO 3 - Tune to Eb

[V1]
.G    G/B      C
 I am full of Earth. You are heaven's worth.
.G    G/B          C
 I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity.||
.G       G/B      C
 You are everything that is bright and clean.
.G       G/B    C
 The antonym of me,|You are divinity.

[P1]
.G/B    C               G        D/F#
 But a certain sign of grace is this:
.G/B        C            G      D/F#
 From the broken earth, flowers come up,
.D
 Pushing through the dirt.

[C]
.         C    G     D
 You are holy, holy, holy.
.                 C      G     D
 All heaven cries holy, holy, God.
.         C    G     D
 You are holy, holy, holy.
.              C   G         D
 I want to be holy like You are.

[V2]
.G G/B C
.G       G/B      C
 You are everything that is bright and clean,
.G           G/B   C
 And You're covering me with your majesty.

[P2]
.G/B       C              G       D/F#
 And the truest sign of grace was this:
.G/B    C            G               D/F#  D
 From wounded hands, redemption fell down, liberating man.

[B]
.F                 C                        G
 But the harder I try, the more clearly can I
.                      D/F#
 Feel the depth of our fall and the weight of it all.||
.C                       G/B
 And so this might could be
.                     G
 The most impossible thing:
.                D/F#             C
 Your grandness in me making me clean.||
.G      D
 Glory, hallelujah,
.C      G      D
 Glory, glory, hallelujah...

[T]
.C             G          D        Em
 So here I am, all of me, finally, everything,
.C       G       D
 Wholly, wholly, wholly.||
.       C     G        D
 I am wholly, wholly, wholly,
.       C     G        D       G  G/B C
 I am wholly, wholly, wholly Yours.
.               G  G/B C
 I am wholly Yours.||
.G                G/B                 C
 And I am full of earth and dirt and You.
.Em      C  Em       C
 Here I am, everything.</lyrics></song>

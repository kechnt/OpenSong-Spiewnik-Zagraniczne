.A E F#m D A E D

[V1]
.F#m           E         F#m   E           F#m             E
 I've got a story to tell,|and I am learning|You've got a story as well,
.D                                    F#m
 Flowing through us, making us who we are.||
.F#m             E              F#m            E
 And just like a river that runs, the story of Jesus comes
.  D                     A             D                      E
 Into our hearts so that we can know|a love so great, it will overflow.

[C1]
.A                 E            F#m                 D
 Let the river run wild and free,|the river of Your love for me.
.        A            E                D
 Fill my heart and my soul 'till I overflow. 

[V2]
.F#m       E                F#m       E
 This is a time to be real, this is a time for courage,
.D              A                 D            E
 Time for going deeper still, for letting go into His will.

[C2]
.A                 E            F#m                 D
 Let the river run wild and free,|the river of Your love for me.
.        A            E                A
 Fill my heart and my soul 'till I overflow.||
.A                 E            F#m                 D
 Let the river run wild and free,|the river of Your grace for me.
.        A            E                D
 Fill my heart and my soul 'till I overflow.

.E
 How you gonna reckon with a God like this?
.B
 When you gonna face what you can't dismiss?
.E                                       B
 Whatcha gonna say to the soul kiss that is my God?||
.E
 Fearsome like the sag in a fat man's chair.
.B
 Sweeter than a patch of Rogaine hair.
.E
 How do you define what you can't compare?
.     B
 This is my God.

[P]
.            D                      D/F#        G
 And there's no use explaining what can't be contained.

[C1]
.C                   G
 I'm not following a God I can lead around;
.C                    G
 I can't tame this Deity.
.C                       G
 That's why Jesus is the final answer
.   Em         C         D
 To who I want my God to be.
.     Em         C         D
 He's who I want my God to be.

[V2]
.E 
 How you gonna reckon with a God this great?
.B 
 Why you gonna measure what you can't equate?
.E                                       B
 Whatcha gonna say to the checkmate that is my God?||
.E 
 Stronger than the burn of an aftershave.
.B 
 Tender as a burger in your microwave.
.E 
 Rarer than the air in an empty grave.
.     B 
 This is my God.

[B]
.F            G         C/E
 How we gonna work this out?
.               F        G        C/E
 To fabricate a God like this, no doubt,
.                          F             G     C/E
 We'd end up worshipping a Christ of our own design.
.                  F        G
 But Jesus doesn't fit that profile;
.F        G
 His ways aren't mine.

[C2]
.C                   G 
 I'm not following a God that's imagined.
.C                    G
 Can't invent this Deity.
.C                       G 
 That's why Jesus is the final answer
.   Em         C         D
 To who I want my God to be.
.     Em         C         D
 He's who I want my God to be.</lyrics></song>

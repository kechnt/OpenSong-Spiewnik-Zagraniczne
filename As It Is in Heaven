 God give us new ev'ry morning|mercy as daily bread.
 In the name of Jesus,|in the name of Jesus we pray.||
 And lead us not to temptation,|but deliver us with Your hand.
 In the name of Jesus,|in the name of Jesus we pray.
 Father, we pray:

[B]

 For the kingdom is Yours,
.        D
 And the power is Yours,
.        Em7             C2
 And the glory forever, amen. (4X)</lyrics>

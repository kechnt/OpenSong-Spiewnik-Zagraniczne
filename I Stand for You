[V1]
.  Bm     A         D
 Jesus, I stand for You.
.          Bm       A       E
 No matter what You lead me through.
.          G        A       D        E
 They will chase me out and close me down,
.       G         A         D
 But, Jesus, I'll stand for You.


[C]
.     G      A           D      Bm
 I'll always stand, I'll always stand,
.     G      A        D
 I'll always stand for You.
.     G      A           D      E
 I'll always stand, I'll always stand,
.     G      A         D
 I'll always stand for You.


[V2]
 Jesus, I've stood my ground
 When unbelief was all around.
 I have felt the sting rejection brings,
 But, Jesus, I'll stand for You.


[B]
.            G   Em          A
 A time will come  when everyone
.D               G   Em             A   D
 Will turn their eyes  on the risen Son.
.      G        D                    G     D
 But until that day, this world will turn away,
.         Bm
 And so I take Your hand;
.     G      A         D
 I'll always stand for You.

[B2]
.D  G  Bm  A  E  G  A  D
.       G     A
 Guilty of disgrace,
.        D       E
 But You took my place,
.      G                Em        D
 So, Jesus, I'll always stand for You.</lyrics>

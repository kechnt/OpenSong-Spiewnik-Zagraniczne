[V]
 Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord.
 We will wait upon the Lord.
 We will wait upon the Lord. (2X)

[P]
 Our God, You reign forever,
 Our hope, our strong Deliverer.

[C1]
 You are the everlasting God,
 The everlasting God.
 You do not faint;
 You won't grow weary.

[C2]
 You are the everlasting God,
 The everlasting God.
 You do not faint;
 You won't grow weary.||
 You're the defender of the weak.
 You comfort those in need.
 You lift us up on wings like eagles.

[T]
 From everlasting, to everlasting,
 God, You are everlasting.</lyrics>

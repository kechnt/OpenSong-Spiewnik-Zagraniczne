.G                      D                       Bm                   C
 Trust in the Lord with all of your heart; lean not on your own understanding. 
.   G                  D                 C       D              G
 In all of your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight.||
.      C             D            G      D     C
 Don't worry about tomorrow; He's got it under control.
.     G                      D                     C       D         G
 Just trust in the Lord with all of your heart and He will carry you through.

[V]
.Em        D                C
 Lord, sometimes it gets so tough
.   G               D                         C
 to keep my eyes on you when things are going rough.
.    G                   D                   G    D    C
 But then I turn my eyes up to the sky and I hear Your voice;
 
 It says to me:</lyrics></song>

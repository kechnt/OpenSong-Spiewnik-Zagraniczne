.D       G            D            A
 Lord, I cried out, I cried out to You.
.    D        G          D     A
 You answered me in Your mercy.
.     D         G
 Your anger was fleeting,
.    D          A             D        G    D   A D
 And now I will dance in your favor all my life.

[C]
.   D         G 
 Let my heart sing for you
.    D            A
 And not...remain silent.
.    D           G
 Let my heart sing for you.
.        D       A      D     A D
 Turn my weeping into a dance.

[B]
.   Bm*             G/B*
 So dance, dance my soul;
.           D*                A/C#*
 There's no reason for you to weep.
.   Bm*             G/B*            
 So dance, dance my soul;
.     D*            A/C#* G/B*
 Make music to your King.
